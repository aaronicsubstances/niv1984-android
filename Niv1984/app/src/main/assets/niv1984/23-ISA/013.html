 <h3>Isaiah 13</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-1">An oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-2">Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-3">I have commanded my holy ones; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath-- those who rejoice in my triumph.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-4">Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-5">They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens-- the LORD and the weapons of his wrath-- to destroy the whole country.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-6">Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-7">Because of this, all hands will go limp, every man's heart will melt.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-8">Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-9">See, the day of the LORD is coming --a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger-- to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-10">The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-11">I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-12">I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-13">Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-14">Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-15">Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-16">Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-17">See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-18">Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-19">Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_2">2</a>]</sup> pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-20">She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-21">But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-013-22">Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.</li>
