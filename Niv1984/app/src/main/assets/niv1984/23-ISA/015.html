 <h3>Isaiah 15</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-1">An oracle concerning Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-2">Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-3">In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-4">Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-5">My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-6">The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-7">So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-8">Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-015-9">Dimon's <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_1">1</a>]</sup> waters are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_2">2</a>]</sup> -- a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.</li>
