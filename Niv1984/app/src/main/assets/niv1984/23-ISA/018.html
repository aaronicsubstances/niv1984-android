 <h3>Isaiah 18</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-1">Woe to the land of whirring wings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_1">1</a>]</sup> along the rivers of Cush, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-2">which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-3">All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-4">This is what the LORD says to me: "I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-5">For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and cut down and take away the spreading branches.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-6">They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-018-7">At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers-- the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD Almighty.</li>
