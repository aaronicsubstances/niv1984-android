 <h3>Isaiah 21</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-1">An oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-2">A dire vision has been shown to me: The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-3">At this my body is racked with pain, pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I am bewildered by what I see.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-4">My heart falters, fear makes me tremble; the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-5">They set the tables, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you officers, oil the shields!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-6">This is what the Lord says to me: "Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-7">When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-8">And the lookout <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup> shouted, "Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-9">Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer: `Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!'"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-10">O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD Almighty, from the God of Israel.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-11">An oracle concerning Dumah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_2">2</a>]</sup> : Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-12">The watchman replies, "Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-13">An oracle concerning Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-14">bring water for the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-15">They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-16">This is what the Lord says to me: "Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-021-17">The survivors of the bowmen, the warriors of Kedar, will be few." The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.</li>
