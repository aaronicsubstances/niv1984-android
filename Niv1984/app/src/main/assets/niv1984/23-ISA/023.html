 <h3>Isaiah 23</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-1">An oracle concerning Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_1">1</a>]</sup> word has come to them.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-2">Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-3">On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_2">2</a>]</sup> was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-4">Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: "I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-5">When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-6">Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-7">Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-8">Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-9">The LORD Almighty planned it, to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-10">Till <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_3">3</a>]</sup> your land as along the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-11">The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_4">4</a>]</sup> that her fortresses be destroyed.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-12">He said, "No more of your reveling, O Virgin Daughter of Sidon, now crushed! "Up, cross over to Cyprus <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_5">5</a>]</sup> ; even there you will find no rest."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-13">Look at the land of the Babylonians, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_6">6</a>]</sup> this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-14">Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your fortress is destroyed!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-15">At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-16">"Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-17">At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-023-18">Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes.</li>
