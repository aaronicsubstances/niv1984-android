 <h3>Isaiah 25</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-1">O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things, things planned long ago.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-2">You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreigners' stronghold a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-3">Therefore strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-4">You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-5">and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-6">On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine-- the best of meats and the finest of wines.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-7">On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-8">he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth. The LORD has spoken.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-9">In that day they will say, "Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-10">The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-11">They will spread out their hands in it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_874045182_1">1</a>]</sup> of their hands.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-025-12">He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.</li>
