 <h3>Isaiah 27</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-1">In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword, his fierce, great and powerful sword, Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-2">In that day-- "Sing about a fruitful vineyard:</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-3">I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-4">I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-5">Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-6">In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-7">Has [the LORD] struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-8">By warfare <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_1">1</a>]</sup> and exile you contend with her-- with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-9">By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_2">2</a>]</sup> or incense altars will be left standing.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-10">The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-11">When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-12">In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_3">3</a>]</sup> to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-027-13">And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.</li>
