 <h3>Isaiah 28</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-1">Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley-- to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-2">See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-3">That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-4">That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest-- as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-5">In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-6">He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-7">And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-8">All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-9">"Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-10">For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup> ; a little here, a little there."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-11">Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-12">to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose"-- but they would not listen.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-13">So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there-- so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-14">Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-15">You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup> we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup> our hiding place."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-16">So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-17">I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-18">Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-19">As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through." The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-20">The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-21">The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon-- to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-22">Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-23">Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-24">When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-25">When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup> barley in its plot, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup> and spelt in its field?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-26">His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-27">Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-28">Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-028-29">All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.</li>
