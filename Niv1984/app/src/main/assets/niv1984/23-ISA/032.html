 <h3>Isaiah 32</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-1">See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-2">Each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-3">Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-4">The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-5">No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-6">For the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil: He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the LORD; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-7">The scoundrel's methods are wicked, he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-8">But the noble man makes noble plans, and by noble deeds he stands.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-9">You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-10">In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-11">Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your clothes, put sackcloth around your waists.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-12">Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-13">and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers-- yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-14">The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-15">till the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-16">Justice will dwell in the desert and righteousness live in the fertile field.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-17">The fruit of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-18">My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-19">Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-032-20">how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.</li>
