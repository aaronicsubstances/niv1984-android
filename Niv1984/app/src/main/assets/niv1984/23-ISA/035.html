 <h3>Isaiah 35</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-1">The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-2">it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-3">Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way;</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-4">say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-5">Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-6">Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-7">The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-8">And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-9">No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-035-10">and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.</li>
