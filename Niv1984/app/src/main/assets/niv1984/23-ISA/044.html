 <h3>Isaiah 44</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-1">"But now listen, O Jacob, my servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-2">This is what the LORD says-- he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not be afraid, O Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-3">For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-4">They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-5">One will say, `I belong to the LORD'; another will call himself by the name of Jacob; still another will write on his hand, `The LORD's,' and will take the name Israel.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-6">"This is what the LORD says-- Israel's King and Redeemer, the LORD Almighty: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-7">Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people, and what is yet to come-- yes, let him foretell what will come.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-8">Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-9">All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-10">Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit him nothing?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-11">He and his kind will be put to shame; craftsmen are nothing but men. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and infamy.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-12">The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-13">The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in the form of man, of man in all his glory, that it may dwell in a shrine.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-14">He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-15">It is man's fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-16">Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm; I see the fire."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-17">From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, "Save me; you are my god."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-18">They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-19">No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-20">He feeds on ashes, a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-21">"Remember these things, O Jacob, for you are my servant, O Israel. I have made you, you are my servant; O Israel, I will not forget you.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-22">I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-23">Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout aloud, O earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, he displays his glory in Israel.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-24">"This is what the LORD says-- your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-25">who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-26">who carries out the words of his servants and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, `It shall be inhabited,' of the towns of Judah, `They shall be built,' and of their ruins, `I will restore them,'</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-27">who says to the watery deep, `Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,'</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-044-28">who says of Cyrus, `He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Let its foundations be laid."'</li>
