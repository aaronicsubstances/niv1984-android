 <h3>Isaiah 53</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-1">Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-2">He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-3">He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-4">Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-5">But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-6">We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-7">He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-8">By oppression <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_1">1</a>]</sup> and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-9">He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-10">Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_3">3</a>]</sup> his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-11">After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light [of life] <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_4">4</a>]</sup> and be satisfied <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_5">5</a>]</sup> ; by his knowledge <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_6">6</a>]</sup> my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-053-12">Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_7">7</a>]</sup> and he will divide the spoils with the strong, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_8">8</a>]</sup> because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</li>
