 <h3>Isaiah 57</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-1">The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-2">Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-3">"But you--come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-4">Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-5">You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-6">[The idols] among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; they, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In the light of these things, should I relent?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-7">You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-8">Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-9">You went to Molech <sup>[<a href="#footnote_186414844_1">1</a>]</sup> with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_186414844_2">2</a>]</sup> far away; you descended to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_186414844_3">3</a>]</sup> itself!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-10">You were wearied by all your ways, but you would not say, `It is hopeless.' You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-11">"Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me, and have neither remembered me nor pondered this in your hearts? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-12">I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-13">When you cry out for help, let your collection [of idols] save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But the man who makes me his refuge will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-14">And it will be said: "Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-15">For this is what the high and lofty One says-- he who lives forever, whose name is holy: "I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-16">I will not accuse forever, nor will I always be angry, for then the spirit of man would grow faint before me-- the breath of man that I have created.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-17">I was enraged by his sinful greed; I punished him, and hid my face in anger, yet he kept on in his willful ways.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-18">I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-19">creating praise on the lips of the mourners in Israel. Peace, peace, to those far and near," says the LORD. "And I will heal them."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-20">But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-057-21">"There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."</li>
