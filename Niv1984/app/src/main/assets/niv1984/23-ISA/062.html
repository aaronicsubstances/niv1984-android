 <h3>Isaiah 62</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-1">For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her righteousness shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-2">The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-3">You will be a crown of splendor in the LORD's hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-4">No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_352055024_1">1</a>]</sup> and your land Beulah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_352055024_2">2</a>]</sup> ; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be married.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-5">As a young man marries a maiden, so will your sons <sup>[<a href="#footnote_352055024_3">3</a>]</sup> marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-6">I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-7">and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-8">The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: "Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies, and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled;</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-9">but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-10">Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-11">The LORD has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: "Say to the Daughter of Zion, `See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-062-12">They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.</li>
