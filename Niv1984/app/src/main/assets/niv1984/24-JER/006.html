 <h3>Jeremiah 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="24-JER-006-1">"Flee for safety, people of Benjamin! Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north, even terrible destruction.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-2">I will destroy the Daughter of Zion, so beautiful and delicate.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-3">Shepherds with their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents around her, each tending his own portion."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-4">"Prepare for battle against her! Arise, let us attack at noon! But, alas, the daylight is fading, and the shadows of evening grow long.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-5">So arise, let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses!"</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-6">This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-7">As a well pours out its water, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her; her sickness and wounds are ever before me.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-8">Take warning, O Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-9">This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand over the branches again, like one gathering grapes."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-10">To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_68325204_1">1</a>]</sup> so they cannot hear. The word of the LORD is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-11">But I am full of the wrath of the LORD, and I cannot hold it in. "Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife will be caught in it, and the old, those weighed down with years.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-12">Their houses will be turned over to others, together with their fields and their wives, when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-13">"From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-14">They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. `Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-15">Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when I punish them," says the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-16">This is what the LORD says: "Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, `We will not walk in it.'</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-17">I appointed watchmen over you and said, `Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But you said, `We will not listen.'</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-18">Therefore hear, O nations; observe, O witnesses, what will happen to them.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-19">Hear, O earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-20">What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-21">Therefore this is what the LORD says: "I will put obstacles before this people. Fathers and sons alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-22">This is what the LORD says: "Look, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-23">They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, O Daughter of Zion."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-24">We have heard reports about them, and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labor.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-25">Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy has a sword, and there is terror on every side.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-26">O my people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-27">"I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore, that you may observe and test their ways.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-28">They are all hardened rebels, going about to slander. They are bronze and iron; they all act corruptly.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-29">The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-006-30">They are called rejected silver, because the LORD has rejected them."</li>
