 <h3>Jeremiah 45</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="24-JER-045-1">This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating:</li>
  <li id="24-JER-045-2">"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:</li>
  <li id="24-JER-045-3">You said, `Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.'"</li>
  <li id="24-JER-045-4">[The LORD said,] "Say this to him: `This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-045-5">Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.'"</li>
