 <h3>Jeremiah 48</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="24-JER-048-1">Concerning Moab: This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; the stronghold <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_1">1</a>]</sup> will be disgraced and shattered.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-2">Moab will be praised no more; in Heshbon <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_2">2</a>]</sup> men will plot her downfall: `Come, let us put an end to that nation.' You too, O Madmen, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_3">3</a>]</sup> will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-3">Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of great havoc and destruction.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-4">Moab will be broken; her little ones will cry out. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-5">They go up the way to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-6">Flee! Run for your lives; become like a bush <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_5">5</a>]</sup> in the desert.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-7">Since you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be taken captive, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-8">The destroyer will come against every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, because the LORD has spoken.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-9">Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_6">6</a>]</sup> ; her towns will become desolate, with no one to live in them.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-10">"A curse on him who is lax in doing the LORD's work! A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed!</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-11">"Moab has been at rest from youth, like wine left on its dregs, not poured from one jar to another-- she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did, and her aroma is unchanged.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-12">But days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will send men who pour from jars, and they will pour her out; they will empty her jars and smash her jugs.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-13">Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-14">"How can you say, `We are warriors, men valiant in battle'?</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-15">Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; her finest young men will go down in the slaughter," declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-16">"The fall of Moab is at hand; her calamity will come quickly.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-17">Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her fame; say, `How broken is the mighty scepter, how broken the glorious staff!'</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-18">"Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitants of the Daughter of Dibon, for he who destroys Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-19">Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ask them, `What has happened?'</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-20">Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-21">Judgment has come to the plateau-- to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-22">to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-23">to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-24">to Kerioth and Bozrah-- to all the towns of Moab, far and near.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-25">Moab's horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_7">7</a>]</sup> is cut off; her arm is broken," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-26">"Make her drunk, for she has defied the LORD. Let Moab wallow in her vomit; let her be an object of ridicule.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-27">Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? Was she caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-28">Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the mouth of a cave.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-29">"We have heard of Moab's pride-- her overweening pride and conceit, her pride and arrogance and the haughtiness of her heart.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-30">I know her insolence but it is futile," declares the LORD, "and her boasts accomplish nothing.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-31">Therefore I wail over Moab, for all Moab I cry out, I moan for the men of Kir Hareseth.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-32">I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, O vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea; they reached as far as the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-33">Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-34">"The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-35">In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-36">"So my heart laments for Moab like a flute; it laments like a flute for the men of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-37">Every head is shaved and every beard cut off; every hand is slashed and every waist is covered with sackcloth.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-38">On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-39">"How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule, an object of horror to all those around her."</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-40">This is what the LORD says: "Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-41">Kerioth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_8">8</a>]</sup> will be captured and the strongholds taken. In that day the hearts of Moab's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-42">Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-43">Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of Moab," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-44">"Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare; for I will bring upon Moab the year of her punishment," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-45">"In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it burns the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-46">Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity.</li>
  <li id="24-JER-048-47">"Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in days to come," declares the LORD. Here ends the judgment on Moab.</li>
