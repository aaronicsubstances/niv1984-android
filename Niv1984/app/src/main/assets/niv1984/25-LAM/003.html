 <h3>Lamentations 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-1"><sup>[<a href="#footnote_202814600_1">1</a>]</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-2">He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-3">indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-4">He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-5">He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-6">He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-7">He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-8">Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-9">He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-10">Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-11">he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-12">He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-13">He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-14">I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-15">He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-16">He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-17">I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-18">So I say, "My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD."</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-19">I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-20">I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-21">Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-22">Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-23">They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-24">I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-25">The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-26">it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-27">It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-28">Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-29">Let him bury his face in the dust-- there may yet be hope.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-30">Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-31">For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-32">Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-33">For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-34">To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-35">to deny a man his rights before the Most High,</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-36">to deprive a man of justice-- would not the Lord see such things?</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-37">Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-38">Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-39">Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-40">Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-41">Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-42">"We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-43">"You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-44">You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-45">You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-46">"All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-47">We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction."</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-48">Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-49">My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-50">until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-51">What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-52">Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-53">They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-54">the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-55">I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-56">You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-57">You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-58">O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-59">You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-60">You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-61">O LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me--</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-62">what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-63">Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-64">Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, for what their hands have done.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-65">Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-003-66">Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD.</li>
