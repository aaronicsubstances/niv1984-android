 <h3>Lamentations 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-1">Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-2">Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, our homes to foreigners.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-3">We have become orphans and fatherless, our mothers like widows.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-4">We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-5">Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-6">We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-7">Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-8">Slaves rule over us, and there is none to free us from their hands.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-9">We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-10">Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-11">Women have been ravished in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-12">Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-13">Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-14">The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-15">Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-16">The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-17">Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-18">for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-19">You, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-20">Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-21">Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old</li>
  <li id="25-LAM-005-22">unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.</li>
