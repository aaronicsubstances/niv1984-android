 <h3>Ezekiel 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-1">In the <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_1">1</a>]</sup> thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-2">On the fifth of the month--it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin--</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-3">the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_2">2</a>]</sup> by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_3">3</a>]</sup> There the hand of the LORD was upon him.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-4">I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-5">and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-6">but each of them had four faces and four wings.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-7">Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-8">Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-9">and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-10">Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-11">Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-12">Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-13">The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-14">The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-15">As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-16">This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-17">As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_4">4</a>]</sup> as the creatures went.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-18">Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-19">When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-20">Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-21">When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-22">Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-23">Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-24">When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_5">5</a>]</sup> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-25">Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-26">Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_6">6</a>]</sup> and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-27">I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-001-28">Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</li>
