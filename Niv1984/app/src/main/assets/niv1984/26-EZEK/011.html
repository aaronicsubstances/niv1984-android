 <h3>Ezekiel 11</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-1">Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance to the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-2">The LORD said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-3">They say, `Will it not soon be time to build houses? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup> This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.'</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-4">Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man."</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-5">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon me, and he told me to say: "This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, O house of Israel, but I know what is going through your mind.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-6">You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-7">"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-8">You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-9">I will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-10">You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-11">This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-12">And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you."</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-13">Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?"</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-14">The word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-15">"Son of man, your brothers--your brothers who are your blood relatives <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup> and the whole house of Israel--are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, `They are <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup> far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.'</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-16">"Therefore say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.'</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-17">"Therefore say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.'</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-18">"They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-19">I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-20">Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-21">But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-22">Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-23">The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-24">The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup> in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-011-25">and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.</li>
