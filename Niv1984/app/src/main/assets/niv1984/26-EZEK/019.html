 <h3>Ezekiel 19</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-1">"Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-2">and say: "`What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-3">She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-4">The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-5">"`When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-6">He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-7">He broke down <sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_1">1</a>]</sup> their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-8">Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-9">With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-10">"`Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard <sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_2">2</a>]</sup> planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-11">Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-12">But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-13">Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-019-14">Fire spread from one of its main <sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_3">3</a>]</sup> branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler's scepter.' This is a lament and is to be used as a lament."</li>
