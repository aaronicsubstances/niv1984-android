 <h3>Ezekiel 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-1">The word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-2">"Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-3">and say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols,</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-4">you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-5">Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-6">"`See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-7">In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the alien and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-8">You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-9">In you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-10">In you are those who dishonor their fathers' bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-11">In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor's wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father's daughter.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-12">In you men accept bribes to shed blood; you take usury and excessive interest <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_1">1</a>]</sup> and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-13">"`I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-14">Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-15">I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-16">When you have been defiled <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_2">2</a>]</sup> in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.'"</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-17">Then the word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-18">"Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-19">Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: `Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-20">As men gather silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-21">I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-22">As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.'"</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-23">Again the word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-24">"Son of man, say to the land, `You are a land that has had no rain or showers <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_3">3</a>]</sup> in the day of wrath.'</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-25">There is a conspiracy of her princes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_4">4</a>]</sup> within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-26">Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-27">Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-28">Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says'--when the LORD has not spoken.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-29">The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien, denying them justice.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-30">"I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-022-31">So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD."</li>
