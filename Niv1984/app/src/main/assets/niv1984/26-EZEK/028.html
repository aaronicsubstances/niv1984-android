 <h3>Ezekiel 28</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-1">The word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-2">"Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`In the pride of your heart you say, "I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas." But you are a man and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-3">Are you wiser than Daniel <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_1">1</a>]</sup> ? Is no secret hidden from you?</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-4">By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-5">By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-6">"`Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`Because you think you are wise, as wise as a god,</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-7">I am going to bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations; they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-8">They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-9">Will you then say, "I am a god," in the presence of those who kill you? You will be but a man, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-10">You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-11">The word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-12">"Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-13">You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and jasper, sapphire, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_2">2</a>]</sup> turquoise and beryl. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_3">3</a>]</sup> Your settings and mountings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_4">4</a>]</sup> were made of gold; on the day you were created they were prepared.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-14">You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-15">You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-16">Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-17">Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-18">By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-19">All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.'"</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-20">The word of the LORD came to me:</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-21">"Son of man, set your face against Sidon; prophesy against her</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-22">and say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`I am against you, O Sidon, and I will gain glory within you. They will know that I am the LORD, when I inflict punishment on her and show myself holy within her.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-23">I will send a plague upon her and make blood flow in her streets. The slain will fall within her, with the sword against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-24">"`No longer will the people of Israel have malicious neighbors who are painful briers and sharp thorns. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-25">"`This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I gather the people of Israel from the nations where they have been scattered, I will show myself holy among them in the sight of the nations. Then they will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.</li>
  <li id="26-EZEK-028-26">They will live there in safety and will build houses and plant vineyards; they will live in safety when I inflict punishment on all their neighbors who maligned them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.'"</li>
