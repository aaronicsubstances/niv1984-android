 <h3>Hosea 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-001-1">The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213291347_1">1</a>]</sup> king of Israel:</li>
  <li id="verse-001-2">When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, "Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-3">So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-4">Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-5">In that day I will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-6">Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213291347_2">2</a>]</sup> for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-7">Yet I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them--not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-8">After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-9">Then the LORD said, "Call him Lo-Ammi, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213291347_3">3</a>]</sup> for you are not my people, and I am not your God.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-10">"Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, `You are not my people,' they will be called `sons of the living God.'</li>
  <li id="verse-001-11">The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited, and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.</li>

  <li id="verse-002-2">"Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-3">Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-4">I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-5">Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, `I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.'</li>
  <li id="verse-002-6">Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-7">She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, `I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.'</li>
  <li id="verse-002-8">She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold-- which they used for Baal.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-9">"Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her nakedness.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-10">So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-11">I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days--all her appointed feasts.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-12">I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-13">I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-14">"Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-15">There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_1">1</a>]</sup> a door of hope. There she will sing <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_2">2</a>]</sup> as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-16">"In that day," declares the LORD, "you will call me `my husband'; you will no longer call me `my master. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_3">3</a>]</sup> '</li>
  <li id="verse-002-17">I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.</li>

  <li id="verse-002-19">I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_4">4</a>]</sup> righteousness and justice, in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_5">5</a>]</sup> love and compassion.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-20">I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-21">"In that day I will respond," declares the LORD-- "I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;</li>
  <li id="verse-002-22">and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_6">6</a>]</sup></li>

 <h3>Hosea 4</h3>

  <li id="verse-004-1">Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: "There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-2">There is only cursing, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_1">1</a>]</sup> lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-3">Because of this the land mourns, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_2">2</a>]</sup> and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-4">"But let no man bring a charge, let no man accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-5">You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother--</li>
  <li id="verse-004-6">my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.</li>

  <li id="verse-004-8">They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.</li>

  <li id="verse-004-10">"They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves</li>
  <li id="verse-004-11">to prostitution, to old wine and new, which take away the understanding</li>
  <li id="verse-004-12">of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-13">They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-14">"I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes-- a people without understanding will come to ruin!</li>
