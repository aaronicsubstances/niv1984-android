 <h3>Hosea 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-1">"Say of your brothers, `My people,' and of your sisters, `My loved one.'</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-2">"Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-3">Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-4">I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-5">Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, `I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.'</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-6">Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-7">She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, `I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.'</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-8">She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold-- which they used for Baal.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-9">"Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her nakedness.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-10">So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-11">I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days--all her appointed feasts.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-12">I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-13">I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-14">"Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-15">There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_1">1</a>]</sup> a door of hope. There she will sing <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_2">2</a>]</sup> as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-16">"In that day," declares the LORD, "you will call me `my husband'; you will no longer call me `my master. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_3">3</a>]</sup> '</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-17">I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-18">In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-19">I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_4">4</a>]</sup> righteousness and justice, in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_5">5</a>]</sup> love and compassion.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-20">I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-21">"In that day I will respond," declares the LORD-- "I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-22">and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_6">6</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-002-23">I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called `Not my loved one. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_7">7</a>]</sup> ' I will say to those called `Not my people, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_8">8</a>]</sup> ' `You are my people'; and they will say, `You are my God.'"</li>
