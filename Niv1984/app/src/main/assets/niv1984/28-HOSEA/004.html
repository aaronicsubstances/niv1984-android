 <h3>Hosea 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-1">Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: "There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-2">There is only cursing, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_1">1</a>]</sup> lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-3">Because of this the land mourns, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_2">2</a>]</sup> and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-4">"But let no man bring a charge, let no man accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-5">You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother--</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-6">my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-7">The more the priests increased, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_3">3</a>]</sup> their <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_4">4</a>]</sup> Glory for something disgraceful.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-8">They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-9">And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-10">"They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-11">to prostitution, to old wine and new, which take away the understanding</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-12">of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-13">They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-14">"I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes-- a people without understanding will come to ruin!</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-15">"Though you commit adultery, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. "Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_5">5</a>]</sup> And do not swear, `As surely as the LORD lives!'</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-16">The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow?</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-17">Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-18">Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-004-19">A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.</li>
