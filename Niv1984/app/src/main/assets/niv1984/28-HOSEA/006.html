 <h3>Hosea 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-1">"Come, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-2">After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-3">Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth."</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-4">"What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-5">Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth; my judgments flashed like lightning upon you.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-6">For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-7">Like Adam, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_168623424_1">1</a>]</sup> they have broken the covenant-- they were unfaithful to me there.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-8">Gilead is a city of wicked men, stained with footprints of blood.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-9">As marauders lie in ambush for a man, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-10">I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. There Ephraim is given to prostitution and Israel is defiled.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-006-11">"Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed.</li>
