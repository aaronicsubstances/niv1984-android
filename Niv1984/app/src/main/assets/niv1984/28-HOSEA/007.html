 <h3>Hosea 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-1">"Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people, whenever I would heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. They practice deceit, thieves break into houses, bandits rob in the streets;</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-2">but they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them; they are always before me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-3">"They delight the king with their wickedness, the princes with their lies.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-4">They are all adulterers, burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-5">On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-6">Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-7">All of them are hot as an oven; they devour their rulers. All their kings fall, and none of them calls on me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-8">"Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is a flat cake not turned over.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-9">Foreigners sap his strength, but he does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray, but he does not notice.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-10">Israel's arrogance testifies against him, but despite all this he does not return to the LORD his God or search for him.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-11">"Ephraim is like a dove, easily deceived and senseless-- now calling to Egypt, now turning to Assyria.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-12">When they go, I will throw my net over them; I will pull them down like birds of the air. When I hear them flocking together, I will catch them.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-13">Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! I long to redeem them but they speak lies against me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-14">They do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail upon their beds. They gather together <sup>[<a href="#footnote_315146978_1">1</a>]</sup> for grain and new wine but turn away from me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-15">I trained them and strengthened them, but they plot evil against me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-007-16">They do not turn to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words. For this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.</li>
