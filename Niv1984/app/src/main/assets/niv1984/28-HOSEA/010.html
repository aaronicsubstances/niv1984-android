 <h3>Hosea 10</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-1">Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-2">Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-3">Then they will say, "We have no king because we did not revere the LORD. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?"</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-4">They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-5">The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_1">1</a>]</sup> Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-6">It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-7">Samaria and its king will float away like a twig on the surface of the waters.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-8">The high places of wickedness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_3">3</a>]</sup> will be destroyed-- it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!"</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-9">"Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel, and there you have remained. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_4">4</a>]</sup> Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-10">When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-11">Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-12">Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers righteousness on you.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-13">But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors,</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-14">the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated-- as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-010-15">Thus will it happen to you, O Bethel, because your wickedness is great. When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.</li>
