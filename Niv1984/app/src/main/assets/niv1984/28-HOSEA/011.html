 <h3>Hosea 11</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-1">"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-2">But the more I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_1">1</a>]</sup> called Israel, the further they went from me. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_2">2</a>]</sup> They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-3">It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-4">I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love; I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-5">"Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-6">Swords will flash in their cities, will destroy the bars of their gates and put an end to their plans.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-7">My people are determined to turn from me. Even if they call to the Most High, he will by no means exalt them.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-8">"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-9">I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I turn and devastate Ephraim. For I am God, and not man-- the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-10">They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-11">They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-011-12">Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One.</li>
