 <h3>Hosea 12</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-1">Ephraim feeds on the wind; he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-2">The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish Jacob <sup>[<a href="#footnote_941945324_1">1</a>]</sup> according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-3">In the womb he grasped his brother's heel; as a man he struggled with God.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-4">He struggled with the angel and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there--</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-5">the LORD God Almighty, the LORD is his name of renown!</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-6">But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-7">The merchant uses dishonest scales; he loves to defraud.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-8">Ephraim boasts, "I am very rich; I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin."</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-9">"I am the LORD your God, [who brought you] out of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_941945324_2">2</a>]</sup> Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of your appointed feasts.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-10">I spoke to the prophets, gave them many visions and told parables through them."</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-11">Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-12">Jacob fled to the country of Aram <sup>[<a href="#footnote_941945324_3">3</a>]</sup> ; Israel served to get a wife, and to pay for her he tended sheep.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-13">The LORD used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he cared for him.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-012-14">But Ephraim has bitterly provoked him to anger; his Lord will leave upon him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt.</li>
