 <h3>Hosea 13</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-1">When Ephraim spoke, men trembled; he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-2">Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of these people, "They offer human sacrifice and kiss <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_1">1</a>]</sup> the calf-idols."</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-3">Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-4">"But I am the LORD your God, [who brought you] out of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_2">2</a>]</sup> Egypt. You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior except me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-5">I cared for you in the desert, in the land of burning heat.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-6">When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-7">So I will come upon them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk by the path.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-8">Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open. Like a lion I will devour them; a wild animal will tear them apart.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-9">"You are destroyed, O Israel, because you are against me, against your helper.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-10">Where is your king, that he may save you? Where are your rulers in all your towns, of whom you said, `Give me a king and princes'?</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-11">So in my anger I gave you a king, and in my wrath I took him away.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-12">The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-13">Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he does not come to the opening of the womb.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-14">"I will ransom them from the power of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_3">3</a>]</sup> ; I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_4">4</a>]</sup> is your destruction? "I will have no compassion,</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-15">even though he thrives among his brothers. An east wind from the LORD will come, blowing in from the desert; his spring will fail and his well dry up. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-013-16">The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open."</li>
