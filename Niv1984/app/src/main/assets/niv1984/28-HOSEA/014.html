 <h3>Hosea 14</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-1">Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall!</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-2">Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to him: "Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141184967_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-3">Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount war-horses. We will never again say `Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion."</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-4">"I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-5">I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots;</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-6">his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-7">Men will dwell again in his shade. He will flourish like the grain. He will blossom like a vine, and his fame will be like the wine from Lebanon.</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-8">O Ephraim, what more have I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141184967_2">2</a>]</sup> to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a green pine tree; your fruitfulness comes from me."</li>
  <li id="28-HOSEA-014-9">Who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He will understand them. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.</li>
