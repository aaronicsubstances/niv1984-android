 <h3>Joel 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-1">The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-2">Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your forefathers?</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-3">Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-4">What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten; what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten; what the young locusts have left other locusts <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_1">1</a>]</sup> have eaten.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-5">Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-6">A nation has invaded my land, powerful and without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-7">It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-8">Mourn like a virgin <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_2">2</a>]</sup> in sackcloth grieving for the husband <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_3">3</a>]</sup> of her youth.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-9">Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-10">The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_4">4</a>]</sup> ; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil fails.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-11">Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-12">The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree-- all the trees of the field--are dried up. Surely the joy of mankind is withered away.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-13">Put on sackcloth, O priests, and mourn; wail, you who minister before the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-14">Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-15">Alas for that day! For the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-16">Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes-- joy and gladness from the house of our God?</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-17">The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_6">6</a>]</sup> The storehouses are in ruins, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-18">How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-19">To you, O LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the open pastures and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-001-20">Even the wild animals pant for you; the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the open pastures.</li>
