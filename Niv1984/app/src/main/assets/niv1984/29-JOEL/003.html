 <h3>Joel 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-1">`In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-2">I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_1">1</a>]</sup> There I will enter into judgment against them concerning my inheritance, my people Israel, for they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-3">They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine that they might drink.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-4">`Now what have you against me, O Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-5">For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-6">You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-7">`See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-8">I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.` The LORD has spoken.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-9">Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-10">Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, `I am strong!`</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-11">Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD!</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-12">`Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-13">Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow-- so great is their wickedness!`</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-15">The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-16">The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the sky will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-17">`Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-18">`In that day the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the LORD's house and will water the valley of acacias. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-19">But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-20">Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations.</li>
  <li id="29-JOEL-003-21">Their bloodguilt, which I have not pardoned, I will pardon.` The LORD dwells in Zion!</li>
