 <h3>Amos 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-001-1">The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa--what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_1">1</a>]</sup> was king of Israel.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-2">He said: "The LORD roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_2">2</a>]</sup> and the top of Carmel withers."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-3">This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-4">I will send fire upon the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-5">I will break down the gate of Damascus; I will destroy the king who is in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_3">3</a>]</sup> the Valley of Aven <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_4">4</a>]</sup> and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir," says the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-6">This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-7">I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-8">I will destroy the king <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_5">5</a>]</sup> of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines is dead," says the Sovereign LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-9">This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-10">I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-11">This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because he pursued his brother with a sword, stifling all compassion, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_6">6</a>]</sup> because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-12">I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-13">This is what the LORD says: "For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-14">I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-15">Her king <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_7">7</a>]</sup> will go into exile, he and his officials together," says the LORD.</li>

 <h3>Amos 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-003-1">Hear this word the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel--against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:</li>
  <li id="verse-003-2">"You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins."</li>
  <li id="verse-003-3">Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-4">Does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey? Does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-5">Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set? Does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-6">When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-7">Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-8">The lion has roared-- who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken-- who can but prophesy?</li>

  <li id="verse-003-10">"They do not know how to do right," declares the LORD, "who hoard plunder and loot in their fortresses."</li>
  <li id="verse-003-11">Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "An enemy will overrun the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses."</li>
  <li id="verse-003-12">This is what the LORD says: "As a shepherd saves from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites be saved, those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="verse-003-13">"Hear this and testify against the house of Jacob," declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty.</li>

  <li id="verse-004-7">"I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up.</li>

  <li id="verse-004-9">"Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, I struck them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-10">"I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-11">"I overthrew some of you as I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_4">4</a>]</sup> overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-12">"Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel."</li>

  <li id="verse-005-3">This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "The city that marches out a thousand strong for Israel will have only a hundred left; the town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left."</li>

  <li id="verse-009-1">I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: "Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away, none will escape.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-2">Though they dig down to the depths of the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_1">1</a>]</sup> from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-3">Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from me at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-4">Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them. I will fix my eyes upon them for evil and not for good."</li>
  <li id="verse-009-5">The Lord, the LORD Almighty, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn-- the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt--</li>
  <li id="verse-009-6">he who builds his lofty palace <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_2">2</a>]</sup> in the heavens and sets its foundation <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_3">3</a>]</sup> on the earth, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land-- the LORD is his name.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-7">"Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_4">4</a>]</sup> ?" declares the LORD. "Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_5">5</a>]</sup> and the Arameans from Kir?</li>
  <li id="verse-009-8">"Surely the eyes of the Sovereign LORD are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth-- yet I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-9">"For I will give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-10">All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, all those who say, `Disaster will not overtake or meet us.'</li>
