 <h3>Amos 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-1">Hear this word the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel--against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-2">"You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-3">Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-4">Does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey? Does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing?</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-5">Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set? Does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch?</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-6">When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-7">Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-8">The lion has roared-- who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken-- who can but prophesy?</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-9">Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-10">"They do not know how to do right," declares the LORD, "who hoard plunder and loot in their fortresses."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-11">Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "An enemy will overrun the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-12">This is what the LORD says: "As a shepherd saves from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites be saved, those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-13">"Hear this and testify against the house of Jacob," declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-14">"On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-003-15">I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished," declares the LORD.</li>
