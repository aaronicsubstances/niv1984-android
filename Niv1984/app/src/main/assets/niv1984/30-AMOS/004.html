 <h3>Amos 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-1">Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, "Bring us some drinks!"</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-2">The Sovereign LORD has sworn by his holiness: "The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-3">You will each go straight out through breaks in the wall, and you will be cast out toward Harmon, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_1">1</a>]</sup> " declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-4">"Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-5">Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings-- boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do," declares the Sovereign LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-6">"I gave you empty stomachs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_3">3</a>]</sup> in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-7">"I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-8">People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-9">"Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, I struck them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-10">"I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-11">"I overthrew some of you as I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_4">4</a>]</sup> overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me," declares the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-12">"Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-004-13">He who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals his thoughts to man, he who turns dawn to darkness, and treads the high places of the earth-- the LORD God Almighty is his name.</li>
