 <h3>Amos 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-1">This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-2">When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!"</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-3">So the LORD relented. "This will not happen," the LORD said.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-4">This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-5">Then I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!"</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-6">So the LORD relented. "This will not happen either," the Sovereign LORD said.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-7">This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-8">And the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" "A plumb line," I replied. Then the Lord said, "Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-9">"The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-10">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: "Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-11">For this is what Amos is saying: "`Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'"</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-12">Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-13">Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom."</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-14">Amos answered Amaziah, "I was neither a prophet nor a prophet's son, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-15">But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, `Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-16">Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, "`Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the house of Isaac.'</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-007-17">"Therefore this is what the LORD says: "`Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_1">1</a>]</sup> country. And Israel will certainly go into exile, away from their native land.'"</li>
