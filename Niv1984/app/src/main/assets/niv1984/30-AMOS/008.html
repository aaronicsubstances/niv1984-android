 <h3>Amos 8</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-1">This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-2">"What do you see, Amos?" he asked. "A basket of ripe fruit," I answered. Then the LORD said to me, "The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-3">"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_1">1</a>]</sup> Many, many bodies--flung everywhere! Silence!"</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-4">Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land,</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-5">saying, "When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?"-- skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales,</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-6">buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-7">The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: "I will never forget anything they have done.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-8">"Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-9">"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-10">I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-11">"The days are coming," declares the Sovereign LORD, "when I will send a famine through the land-- not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-12">Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-13">"In that day "the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.</li>
  <li id="30-AMOS-008-14">They who swear by the shame <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_2">2</a>]</sup> of Samaria, or say, `As surely as your god lives, O Dan,' or, `As surely as the god <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_3">3</a>]</sup> of Beersheba lives'-- they will fall, never to rise again."</li>
