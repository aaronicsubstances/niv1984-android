 <h3>Jonah 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-1">From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-2">He said: "In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_1">1</a>]</sup> I called for help, and you listened to my cry.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-3">You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-4">I said, `I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.'</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-5">The engulfing waters threatened me, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_2">2</a>]</sup> the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-6">To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-7">"When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-8">"Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-9">But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD."</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-002-10">And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</li>
