 <h3>Jonah 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-1">Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-2">"Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you."</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-3">Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city--a visit required three days.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-4">On the first day, Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed: "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned."</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-5">The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-6">When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-7">Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-8">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-9">Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish."</li>
  <li id="32-JONAH-003-10">When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.</li>
