 <h3>Micah 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-1">Listen to what the LORD says: "Stand up, plead your case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-2">Hear, O mountains, the LORD's accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-3">"My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-4">I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-5">My people, remember what Balak king of Moab counseled and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember [your journey] from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD."</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-6">With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-7">Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-8">He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-9">Listen! The LORD is calling to the city-- and to fear your name is wisdom-- "Heed the rod and the One who appointed it. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-10">Am I still to forget, O wicked house, your ill-gotten treasures and the short ephah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_2">2</a>]</sup> which is accursed?</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-11">Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-12">Her rich men are violent; her people are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-13">Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin you because of your sins.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-14">You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_3">3</a>]</sup> You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-15">You will plant but not harvest; you will press olives but not use the oil on yourselves, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.</li>
  <li id="33-MICAH-006-16">You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house, and you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_4">4</a>]</sup> "</li>
