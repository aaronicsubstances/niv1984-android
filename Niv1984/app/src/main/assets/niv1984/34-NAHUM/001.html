 <h3>Nahum 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-1">An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-2">The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-3">The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-4">He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-5">The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-6">Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-7">The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-8">but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of [Nineveh]; he will pursue his foes into darkness.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-9">Whatever they plot against the LORD he <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_1">1</a>]</sup> will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-10">They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-11">From you, [O Nineveh,] has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and counsels wickedness.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-12">This is what the LORD says: "Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be cut off and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, [O Judah,] I will afflict you no more.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-13">Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away."</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-14">The LORD has given a command concerning you, [Nineveh]: "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile."</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-001-15">Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.</li>
