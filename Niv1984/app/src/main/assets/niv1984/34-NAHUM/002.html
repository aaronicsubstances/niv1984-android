 <h3>Nahum 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-1">An attacker advances against you, [Nineveh]. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-2">The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-3">The shields of his soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of pine are brandished. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-4">The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-5">He summons his picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-6">The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-7">It is decreed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_2">2</a>]</sup> that [the city] be exiled and carried away. Its slave girls moan like doves and beat upon their breasts.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-8">Nineveh is like a pool, and its water is draining away. "Stop! Stop!" they cry, but no one turns back.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-9">Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures!</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-10">She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-11">Where now is the lions' den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear?</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-12">The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey.</li>
  <li id="34-NAHUM-002-13">"I am against you," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard."</li>
