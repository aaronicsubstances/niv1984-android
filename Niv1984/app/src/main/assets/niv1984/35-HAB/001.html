 <h2>Habakkuk</h2>
 <h3>Habakkuk 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-1">The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-2">How long, O LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save?</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-3">Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-4">Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-5">"Look at the nations and watch-- and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-6">I am raising up the Babylonians, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_756827092_1">1</a>]</sup> that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-7">They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-8">Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour;</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-9">they all come bent on violence. Their hordes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_756827092_2">2</a>]</sup> advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-10">They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; they build earthen ramps and capture them.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-11">Then they sweep past like the wind and go on-- guilty men, whose own strength is their god."</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-12">O LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-13">Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-14">You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-15">The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-16">Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-001-17">Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?</li>
