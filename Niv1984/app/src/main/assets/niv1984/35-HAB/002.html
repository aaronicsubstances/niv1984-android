 <h3>Habakkuk 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-1">I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-2">Then the LORD replied: "Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_2">2</a>]</sup> may run with it.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-3">For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_3">3</a>]</sup> will certainly come and will not delay.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-4">"See, he is puffed up; his desires are not upright-- but the righteous will live by his faith <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_4">4</a>]</sup> --</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-5">indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_5">5</a>]</sup> and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-6">"Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, "`Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?'</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-7">Will not your debtors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_6">6</a>]</sup> suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their victim.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-8">Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed man's blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-9">"Woe to him who builds his realm by unjust gain to set his nest on high, to escape the clutches of ruin!</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-10">You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-11">The stones of the wall will cry out, and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-12">"Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime!</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-13">Has not the LORD Almighty determined that the people's labor is only fuel for the fire, that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-14">For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-15">"Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-16">You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and be exposed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_7">7</a>]</sup> ! The cup from the LORD's right hand is coming around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-17">The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed man's blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-18">"Of what value is an idol, since a man has carved it? Or an image that teaches lies? For he who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-19">Woe to him who says to wood, `Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, `Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it.</li>
  <li id="35-HAB-002-20">But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him."</li>
