 <h3>Zechariah 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-1">Then he showed me Joshua <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_1">1</a>]</sup> the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_2">2</a>]</sup> standing at his right side to accuse him.</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-2">The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?"</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-3">Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-4">The angel said to those who were standing before him, "Take off his filthy clothes." Then he said to Joshua, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you."</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-5">Then I said, "Put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the LORD stood by.</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-6">The angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-7">"This is what the LORD Almighty says: `If you will walk in my ways and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-8">"`Listen, O high priest Joshua and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-9">See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_3">3</a>]</sup> on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,' says the LORD Almighty, `and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.</li>
  <li id="38-ZECH-003-10">"`In that day each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree,' declares the LORD Almighty."</li>
