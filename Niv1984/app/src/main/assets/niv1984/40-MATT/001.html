  <li id="40-MATT-001-2">Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-3">Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-4">Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-5">Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-6">and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-7">Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-8">Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-9">Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-10">Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-11">and Josiah the father of Jeconiah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_1">1</a>]</sup> and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-12">After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-13">Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-14">Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-15">Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-16">and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-17">Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-18">This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-19">Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-20">But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-21">She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_3">3</a>]</sup> because he will save his people from their sins."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-22">All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-23">"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_4">4</a>]</sup> --which means, "God with us."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-24">When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-001-25">But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</li>
