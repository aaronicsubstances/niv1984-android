 <h3>Matthew 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-1">In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-2">and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-3">This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-4">John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-5">People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-6">Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-8">Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-9">And do not think you can say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-10">The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-11">"I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_2">2</a>]</sup> water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-12">His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-14">But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-15">Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-16">As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-003-17">And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."</li>
