 <h3>Matthew 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-1">Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-2">After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-3">The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-4">Jesus answered, "It is written: `Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-5">Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-6">"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: "`He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-7">Jesus answered him, "It is also written: `Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-9">"All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-10">Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: `Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-11">Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-12">When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-13">Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-14">to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-15">"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-16">the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-17">From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-18">As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-19">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-20">At once they left their nets and followed him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-21">Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-22">and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-23">Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-24">News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-004-25">Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_6">6</a>]</sup> Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.</li>
