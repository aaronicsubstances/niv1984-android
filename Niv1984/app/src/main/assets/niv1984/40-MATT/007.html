 <h3>Matthew 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-1">"Do not judge, or you too will be judged.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-2">For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-3">"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-4">How can you say to your brother, `Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-5">You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-6">"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-7">"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-8">For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-9">"Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-10">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-11">If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-12">So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-13">"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-14">But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-15">"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-16">By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-17">Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-18">A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-19">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-20">Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-21">"Not everyone who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-22">Many will say to me on that day, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-23">Then I will tell them plainly, `I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-24">"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-25">The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-26">But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-27">The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-28">When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-007-29">because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.</li>
