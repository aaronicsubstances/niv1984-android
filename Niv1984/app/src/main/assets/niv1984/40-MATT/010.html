 <h3>Matthew 10</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-1">He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_1">1</a>]</sup> spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-2">These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-3">Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-4">Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-5">These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-6">Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-7">As you go, preach this message: `The kingdom of heaven is near.'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-8">Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_2">2</a>]</sup> drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-9">Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts;</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-10">take no bag for the journey, or extra tunic, or sandals or a staff; for the worker is worth his keep.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-11">"Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-12">As you enter the home, give it your greeting.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-13">If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-14">If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-15">I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-16">I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-17">"Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-18">On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-19">But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-20">for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-21">"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-22">All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-23">When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-24">"A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-25">It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_3">3</a>]</sup> how much more the members of his household!</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-26">"So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-27">What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-28">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-29">Are not two sparrows sold for a penny <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_4">4</a>]</sup> ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-30">And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-31">So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-32">"Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-33">But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-34">"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-35">For I have come to turn "`a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-36">a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-37">"Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-38">and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-39">Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-40">"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-41">Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-010-42">And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward."</li>
