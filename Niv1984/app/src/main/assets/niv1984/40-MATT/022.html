 <h3>Matthew 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-1">Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-2">"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-3">He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-4">"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-5">"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-6">The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-7">The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-8">"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-9">Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-10">So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-11">"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-12">`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-13">"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-14">"For many are invited, but few are chosen."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-15">Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-16">They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-17">Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-18">But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-19">Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-20">and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?"</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-21">"Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-22">When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-23">That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-24">"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-25">Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-26">The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-27">Finally, the woman died.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-28">Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-29">Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-30">At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-31">But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-32">`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_1">1</a>]</sup> ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-33">When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-34">Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-35">One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-36">"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-37">Jesus replied: "`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-38">This is the first and greatest commandment.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-39">And the second is like it: `Love your neighbor as yourself.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-40">All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-42">"What do you think about the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_4">4</a>]</sup> ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-43">He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him `Lord'? For he says,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-44">"`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-45">If then David calls him `Lord,' how can he be his son?"</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-022-46">No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.</li>
