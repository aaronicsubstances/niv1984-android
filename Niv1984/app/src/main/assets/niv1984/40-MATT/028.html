 <h3>Matthew 28</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-1">After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-2">There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-4">The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-5">The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-6">He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples: `He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-8">So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-9">Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-10">Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-11">While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-12">When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-13">telling them, "You are to say, `His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-14">If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-15">So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-16">Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-17">When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-18">Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-19">Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_176146340_1">1</a>]</sup> the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</li>
  <li id="40-MATT-028-20">and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."</li>
