 <h2>Mark</h2>
 <h3>Mark 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-1">The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_2">2</a>]</sup> --</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-3">"a voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-4">And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-5">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-6">John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-7">And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-8">I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_4">4</a>]</sup> water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-9">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-10">As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-11">And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-12">At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-13">and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-14">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-15">"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-16">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-17">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-19">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-20">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-21">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-22">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-23">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_5">5</a>]</sup> spirit cried out,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-24">"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-25">"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-26">The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-27">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-28">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-30">Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-31">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-32">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-33">The whole town gathered at the door,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-34">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-35">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-36">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-37">and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-38">Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-39">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-40">A man with leprosy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_6">6</a>]</sup> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-41">Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-43">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-44">"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-001-45">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</li>
