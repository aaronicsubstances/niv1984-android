 <h3>Mark 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-1">The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-2">saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-3">(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-4">When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_1">1</a>]</sup> )</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-5">So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with `unclean' hands?"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-6">He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "`These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-7">They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-8">You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-9">And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_3">3</a>]</sup> your own traditions!</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-10">For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother,' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_4">4</a>]</sup> and, `Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-11">But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: `Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-12">then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-13">Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-14">Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-15">Nothing outside a man can make him `unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him `unclean.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_6">6</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-16">After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-17">"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him `unclean'?</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-18">For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-19">He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him `unclean.'</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-20">For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-21">greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-22">All these evils come from inside and make a man `unclean.'"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-23">Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_7">7</a>]</sup> He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-24">In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_8">8</a>]</sup> spirit came and fell at his feet.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-25">The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-26">"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-27">"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-28">Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-29">She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-30">Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_9">9</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-31">There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-32">After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-33">He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!").</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-34">At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-35">Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-007-36">People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</li>
