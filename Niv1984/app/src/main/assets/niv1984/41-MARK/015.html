 <h3>Mark 15</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-1">Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-2">"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-3">The chief priests accused him of many things.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-4">So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-5">But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-6">Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-7">A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-8">The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-9">"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-10">knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-12">"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-13">"Crucify him!" they shouted.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-14">"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-15">Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-16">The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-17">They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-18">And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-19">Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-21">A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-22">They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-23">Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-24">And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-25">It was the third hour when they crucified him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-26">The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-27">They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-28">Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-29">come down from the cross and save yourself!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-30">In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-31">Let this Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup> this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-32">At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-33">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-34">When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-35">One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-36">With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-37">The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-38">And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup> saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup> of God!"</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-39">Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-40">In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-41">It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-42">Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-43">Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-44">When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-45">So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</li>
  <li id="41-MARK-015-46">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</li>
