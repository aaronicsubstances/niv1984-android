 <h3>Luke 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-1">In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-2">during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-3">He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-4">As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-5">Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-6">And all mankind will see God's salvation.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-7">John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-8">Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-9">The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-10">"What should we do then?" the crowd asked.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-11">John answered, "The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-12">Tax collectors also came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-13">"Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-14">Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely--be content with your pay."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-15">The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-16">John answered them all, "I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_3">3</a>]</sup> water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-17">His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-18">And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-19">But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-20">Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-21">When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-22">and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-23">Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-24">the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-25">the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</li>

  <li id="42-LUKE-003-33">the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_5">5</a>]</sup> the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-34">the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-003-35">the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</li>
