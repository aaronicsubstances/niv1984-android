 <h3>Luke 15</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-1">Now the tax collectors and "sinners" were all gathering around to hear him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-2">But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-3">Then Jesus told them this parable:</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-4">"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-5">And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-6">and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-7">I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-8">"Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_1">1</a>]</sup> and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-9">And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-10">In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-11">Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-12">The younger one said to his father, `Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-13">"Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-14">After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-15">So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-16">He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-17">"When he came to his senses, he said, `How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-18">I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-19">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.'</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-20">So he got up and went to his father. "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-21">"The son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_2">2</a>]</sup> '</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-22">"But the father said to his servants, `Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-23">Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-24">For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-25">"Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-26">So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-27">`Your brother has come,' he replied, `and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-28">"The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-29">But he answered his father, `Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-30">But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-31">"`My son,' the father said, `you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-015-32">But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"</li>
