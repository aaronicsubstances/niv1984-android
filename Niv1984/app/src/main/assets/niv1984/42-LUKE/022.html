 <h3>Luke 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-1">Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-2">and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-3">Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-4">And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-5">They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-6">He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-7">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-8">Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-9">"Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-10">He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-11">and say to the owner of the house, `The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-12">He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-13">They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-14">When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-15">And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-16">For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-17">After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-18">For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-19">And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-20">In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-21">But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-22">The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-23">They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-24">Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-25">Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-26">But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-27">For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-28">You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-29">And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-30">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-31">"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_1">1</a>]</sup> as wheat.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-32">But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-33">But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-34">Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-35">Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-36">He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-37">It is written: `And he was numbered with the transgressors' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_2">2</a>]</sup> ; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-38">The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." "That is enough," he replied.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-39">Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-40">On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-41">He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-42">"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-43">An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-44">And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-45">When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-46">"Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-47">While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-48">but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-49">When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-51">But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-53">Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-54">Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-55">But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-56">A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-57">But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-58">A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-59">About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-60">Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-61">The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-62">And he went outside and wept bitterly.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-63">The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-64">They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-65">And they said many other insulting things to him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-66">At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-67">"If you are the Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_4">4</a>]</sup> " they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-68">and if I asked you, you would not answer.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-69">But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-70">They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-022-71">Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."</li>
