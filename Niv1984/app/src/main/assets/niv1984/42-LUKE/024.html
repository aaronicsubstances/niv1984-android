 <h3>Luke 24</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-1">On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-2">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-3">but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-4">While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-5">In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-6">He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-7">`The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-8">Then they remembered his words.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-9">When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-10">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-11">But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-12">Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-13">Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles <sup>[<a href="#footnote_194399283_1">1</a>]</sup> from Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-14">They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-15">As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-16">but they were kept from recognizing him.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-17">He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-18">One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-19">"What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-20">The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-21">but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-22">In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-23">but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-24">Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-25">He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-26">Did not the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_194399283_2">2</a>]</sup> have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-27">And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-28">As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-29">But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-30">When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-31">Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-32">They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-33">They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-34">and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-35">Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-36">While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-37">They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-38">He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-39">Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-40">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-41">And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-43">and he took it and ate it in their presence.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-44">He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-45">Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-46">He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-47">and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-48">You are witnesses of these things.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-49">I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-50">When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-51">While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-52">Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</li>
  <li id="42-LUKE-024-53">And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</li>
