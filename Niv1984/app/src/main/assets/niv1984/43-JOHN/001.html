 <h2>John</h2>
 <h3>John 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-2">He was with God in the beginning.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-3">Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-4">In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-5">The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_1">1</a>]</sup> it.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-6">There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-7">He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-8">He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-9">The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-10">He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-11">He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-12">Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-13">children born not of natural descent, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_3">3</a>]</sup> nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-14">The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_4">4</a>]</sup> who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-15">John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, `He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-16">From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-18">No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_5">5</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_6">6</a>]</sup> who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-19">Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-20">He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_7">7</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-21">They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-22">Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-23">John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, `Make straight the way for the Lord.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_8">8</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-24">Now some Pharisees who had been sent</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-25">questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-26">"I baptize with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_9">9</a>]</sup> water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-27">He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-28">This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-30">This is the one I meant when I said, `A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-31">I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-32">Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-33">I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, `The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-34">I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-35">The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-36">When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-37">When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-38">Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-39">"Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-40">Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-41">The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-42">And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_10">10</a>]</sup> ).</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-43">The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-44">Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-45">Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-46">"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-47">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-48">"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-49">Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-50">Jesus said, "You believe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_11">11</a>]</sup> because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-001-51">He then added, "I tell you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_12">12</a>]</sup> the truth, you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_13">13</a>]</sup> shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</li>
