 <h3>John 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-1">The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-2">although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-3">When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-4">Now he had to go through Samaria.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-5">So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-6">Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-7">When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-8">(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-9">The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup> )</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-10">Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-11">"Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-13">Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-14">but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-15">The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-16">He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-17">"I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-18">The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-19">"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-21">Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-22">You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-23">Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-24">God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-25">The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-26">Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-27">Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-28">Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-29">"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_2">2</a>]</sup> ?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-30">They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-31">Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-32">But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-33">Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-34">"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-35">Do you not say, `Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-36">Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-37">Thus the saying `One sows and another reaps' is true.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-38">I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-39">Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-40">So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-41">And because of his words many more became believers.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-42">They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-43">After the two days he left for Galilee.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-44">(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-45">When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-46">Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-47">When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-48">"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-49">The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-50">Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-51">While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-52">When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-53">Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-004-54">This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</li>
