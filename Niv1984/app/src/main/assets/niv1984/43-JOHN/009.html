 <h3>John 9</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-1">As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-2">His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-3">"Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-4">As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-5">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-6">Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-7">"Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-8">His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-9">Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-10">"How then were your eyes opened?" they demanded.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-11">He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-12">"Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-13">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-14">Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-15">Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-16">Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-17">Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-18">The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-19">"Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-20">"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-21">But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-22">His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_1">1</a>]</sup> would be put out of the synagogue.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-23">That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-24">A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_2">2</a>]</sup> " they said. "We know this man is a sinner."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-25">He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-26">Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-27">He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-28">Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-29">We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-30">The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-31">We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-32">Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-34">To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-36">"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-37">Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-38">Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-39">Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-40">Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-009-41">Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</li>
