 <h3>John 14</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-1">"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_1">1</a>]</sup> ; trust also in me.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-2">In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-3">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-4">You know the way to the place where I am going."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-5">Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-6">Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-7">If you really knew me, you would know <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_2">2</a>]</sup> my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-8">Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-9">Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father'?</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-10">Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-11">Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-12">I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-13">And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-14">You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-15">"If you love me, you will obey what I command.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-16">And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever--</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-17">the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_3">3</a>]</sup> in you.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-18">I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-19">Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-20">On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-21">Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him."</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-22">Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?"</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-23">Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-24">He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-25">"All this I have spoken while still with you.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-26">But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-27">Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-28">"You heard me say, `I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-29">I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-30">I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me,</li>
  <li id="43-JOHN-014-31">but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me. "Come now; let us leave.</li>
