 <h3>Acts 11</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-1">The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-2">So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-3">and said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-4">Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened:</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-5">"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-6">I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-7">Then I heard a voice telling me, `Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-8">"I replied, `Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-9">"The voice spoke from heaven a second time, `Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-10">This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-11">"Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-12">The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-13">He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, `Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-14">He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-15">"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-16">Then I remembered what the Lord had said: `John baptized with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_1">1</a>]</sup> water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-17">So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?"</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-18">When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-19">Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-20">Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-21">The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-22">News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-23">When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-24">He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-25">Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-26">and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-27">During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-28">One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-29">The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-011-30">This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</li>
