 <h3>Acts 24</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-1">Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-2">When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-3">Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-4">But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-5">"We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-6">and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-7">By <sup>[<a href="#footnote_947371799_1">1</a>]</sup> examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-8">The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-9">When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: "I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-10">You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-11">My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-12">And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-13">However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-14">and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-15">So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-16">"After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-17">I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-18">But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-19">Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin--</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-20">unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: `It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-21">Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-22">He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-23">Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-24">As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-25">At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-024-26">When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</li>
