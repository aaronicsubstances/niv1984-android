 <h3>Acts 26</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-2">"King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-3">and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-4">"The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-5">They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-6">And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-7">This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-8">Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-9">"I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-10">And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-11">Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-12">"On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-13">About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-14">We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_1">1</a>]</sup> `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-15">"Then I asked, `Who are you, Lord?' "`I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-16">`Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-17">I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-18">to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-19">"So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-20">First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-21">That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-22">But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-23">that the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_2">2</a>]</sup> would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-24">At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. "You are out of your mind, Paul!" he shouted. "Your great learning is driving you insane."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-25">"I am not insane, most excellent Festus," Paul replied. "What I am saying is true and reasonable.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-26">The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-28">Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?"</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-29">Paul replied, "Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-30">The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-31">They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said, "This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment."</li>
  <li id="44-ACTS-026-32">Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."</li>
