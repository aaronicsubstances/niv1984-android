 <h3>Romans 9</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-1">I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit--</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-2">I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-3">For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-4">the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-5">Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_1">1</a>]</sup> Amen.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-6">It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-7">Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-8">In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-9">For this was how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-10">Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-11">Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand:</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-12">not by works but by him who calls--she was told, "The older will serve the younger." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-13">Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-14">What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-15">For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_6">6</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-16">It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-17">For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_7">7</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-18">Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-19">One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?"</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-20">But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, `Why did you make me like this?'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_8">8</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-21">Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-22">What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction?</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-23">What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory--</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-24">even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-25">As he says in Hosea: "I will call them `my people' who are not my people; and I will call her `my loved one' who is not my loved one," <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_9">9</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-26">and, "It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, `You are not my people,' they will be called `sons of the living God.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_10">10</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-27">Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-28">For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_11">11</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-29">It is just as Isaiah said previously: "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_12">12</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-30">What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-31">but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-32">Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone."</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-009-33">As it is written: "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_13">13</a>]</sup></li>
