 <h3>Romans 11</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-1">I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-2">God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-3">"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-4">And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-5">So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-6">And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-7">What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-8">as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-9">And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-10">May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-11">Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-12">But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-13">I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-14">in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-16">If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-17">If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-18">do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-19">You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-20">Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-22">Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-23">And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-24">After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-25">I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-26">And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-27">And this is <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_6">6</a>]</sup> my covenant with them when I take away their sins." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_7">7</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-28">As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-29">for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-30">Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-31">so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_8">8</a>]</sup> receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-32">For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-33">Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_9">9</a>]</sup> knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-34">"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_10">10</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-35">"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_11">11</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-011-36">For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.</li>
