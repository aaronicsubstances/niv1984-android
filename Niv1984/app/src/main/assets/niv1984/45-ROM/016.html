  <li id="45-ROM-016-1">I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_1">1</a>]</sup> of the church in Cenchrea.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-2">I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-3">Greet Priscilla <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_2">2</a>]</sup> and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-4">They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-5">Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-6">Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-7">Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-8">Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-9">Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.</li>

  <li id="45-ROM-016-16">Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-17">I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-18">For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-19">Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-20">The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-21">Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-22">I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-23">Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-24">Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-25">but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him--</li>
  <li id="45-ROM-016-26">to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.</li>
