 <h3>1 Corinthians 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-1">It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father's wife.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-2">And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-3">Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-4">When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-5">hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_1">1</a>]</sup> may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-6">Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-7">Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-8">Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-9">I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-10">not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-11">But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-12">What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-005-13">God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from among you." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
