 <h3>1 Corinthians 11</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-1">Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-2">I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_854534052_1">1</a>]</sup> just as I passed them on to you.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-3">Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-4">Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-5">And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-6">If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-7">A man ought not to cover his head, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_854534052_2">2</a>]</sup> since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-8">For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-9">neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-10">For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-11">In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-12">For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-13">Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-14">Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-15">but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-16">If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-17">In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-18">In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-19">No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-20">When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-21">for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-22">Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-23">For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-24">and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-25">In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-26">For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-27">Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-28">A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-29">For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-30">That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-31">But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-32">When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-33">So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-011-34">If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.</li>
