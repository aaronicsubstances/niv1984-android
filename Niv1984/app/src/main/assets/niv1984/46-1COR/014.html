 <h3>1 Corinthians 14</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-1">Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-2">For anyone who speaks in a tongue <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_1">1</a>]</sup> does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-3">But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-4">He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-5">I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_3">3</a>]</sup> but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_4">4</a>]</sup> unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-6">Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-7">Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-8">Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-9">So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-10">Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-11">If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-12">So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-13">For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-15">So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-16">If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_5">5</a>]</sup> say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-17">You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-19">But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-20">Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-21">In the Law it is written: "Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_6">6</a>]</sup> says the Lord.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-22">Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-23">So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_7">7</a>]</sup> or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-24">But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_8">8</a>]</sup> comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-25">and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-26">What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-27">If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-28">If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-29">Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-30">And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-31">For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-32">The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-33">For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-34">women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-35">If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-36">Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-37">If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-38">If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_9">9</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-39">Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-014-40">But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.</li>
