 <h3>1 Corinthians 16</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-1">Now about the collection for God's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-2">On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-3">Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-4">If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-5">After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you--for I will be going through Macedonia.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-6">Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-7">I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-8">But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-9">because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-10">If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-11">No one, then, should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-12">Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-13">Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-14">Do everything in love.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-15">You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you, brothers,</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-16">to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at it.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-17">I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-19">The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_1">1</a>]</sup> greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-20">All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-21">I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-22">If anyone does not love the Lord--a curse be on him. Come, O Lord <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_2">2</a>]</sup> !</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-23">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</li>
  <li id="46-1COR-016-24">My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
