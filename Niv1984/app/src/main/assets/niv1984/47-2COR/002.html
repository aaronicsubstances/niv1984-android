 <h3>2 Corinthians 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-1">So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-2">For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-3">I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-4">For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-5">If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-6">The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-7">Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-8">I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-9">The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-10">If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-11">in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-12">Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-13">I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-14">But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-15">For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-16">To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-002-17">Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</li>
