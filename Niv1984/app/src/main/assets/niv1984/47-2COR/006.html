 <h3>2 Corinthians 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-1">As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-2">For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_1">1</a>]</sup> I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-3">We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-4">Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-5">in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-6">in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-7">in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-8">through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-9">known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-10">sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-11">We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-12">We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-13">As a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts also.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-14">Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-15">What harmony is there between Christ and Belial <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_2">2</a>]</sup> ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-16">What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-17">"Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="47-2COR-006-18">"I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
