 <h3>2 Corinthians 11</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-1">I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-2">I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-3">But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-4">For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-5">But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those "super-apostles."</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-6">I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-7">Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-8">I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-9">And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-10">As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-11">Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-12">And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-14">And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-15">It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-16">I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-17">In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-18">Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-19">You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-20">In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-21">To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-22">Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-23">Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-24">Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-25">Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-26">I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-27">I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-28">Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-29">Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-30">If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-32">In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.</li>
  <li id="47-2COR-011-33">But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.</li>
