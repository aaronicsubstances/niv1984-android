 <h2>Galatians</h2>
 <h3>Galatians 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-1">Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-2">and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia:</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-4">who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-5">to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-6">I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-7">which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-9">As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-10">Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-11">I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-12">I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-13">For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-14">I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-15">But when God, who set me apart from birth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_1">1</a>]</sup> and called me by his grace, was pleased</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-16">to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-18">Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_2">2</a>]</sup> and stayed with him fifteen days.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-19">I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-20">I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-21">Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-22">I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-23">They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-001-24">And they praised God because of me.</li>
