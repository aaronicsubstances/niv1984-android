 <h3>Galatians 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-1">Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-2">Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-3">If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-4">Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-5">for each one should carry his own load.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-6">Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-7">Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-8">The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature <sup>[<a href="#footnote_187326134_1">1</a>]</sup> will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-9">Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-10">Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-11">See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-12">Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-13">Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-14">May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which <sup>[<a href="#footnote_187326134_2">2</a>]</sup> the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-15">Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-16">Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-17">Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</li>
  <li id="48-GAL-006-18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</li>
