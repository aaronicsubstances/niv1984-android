 <h3>Ephesians 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-1">For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-2">Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-3">that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-4">In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-5">which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-6">This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-7">I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-8">Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-9">and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-10">His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-11">according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-12">In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-13">I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-14">For this reason I kneel before the Father,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-15">from whom his whole family <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup> in heaven and on earth derives its name.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-16">I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-17">so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-18">may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-19">and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-20">Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-003-21">to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.</li>
