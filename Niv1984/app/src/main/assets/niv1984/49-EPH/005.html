 <h3>Ephesians 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-1">Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-2">and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-3">But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-4">Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-5">For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-6">Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-7">Therefore do not be partners with them.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-8">For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-9">(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-10">and find out what pleases the Lord.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-11">Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-12">For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-13">But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-14">for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: "Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-15">Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-16">making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-17">Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-18">Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-19">Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-20">always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-21">Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-22">Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-23">For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-24">Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-26">to make her holy, cleansing <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_2">2</a>]</sup> her by the washing with water through the word,</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-27">and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-28">In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-29">After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-30">for we are members of his body.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-31">"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-32">This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.</li>
  <li id="49-EPH-005-33">However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</li>
