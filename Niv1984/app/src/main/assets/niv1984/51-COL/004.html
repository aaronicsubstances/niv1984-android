 <h3>Colossians 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="51-COL-004-1">Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-2">Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-3">And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-4">Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-5">Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-6">Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-7">Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-8">I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_1">1</a>]</sup> circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-9">He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-10">My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-11">Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-12">Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-13">I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-14">Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-15">Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-16">After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-17">Tell Archippus: "See to it that you complete the work you have received in the Lord."</li>
  <li id="51-COL-004-18">I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</li>
