 <h3>1 Thessalonians 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-1">Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-2">for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-3">While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-4">But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-5">You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-6">So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-7">For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-8">But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-9">For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-10">He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-11">Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-12">Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-13">Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-14">And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-15">Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-16">Be joyful always;</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-17">pray continually;</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-18">give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-19">Do not put out the Spirit's fire;</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-20">do not treat prophecies with contempt.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-21">Test everything. Hold on to the good.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-22">Avoid every kind of evil.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-23">May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-24">The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-25">Brothers, pray for us.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-26">Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-27">I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.</li>
  <li id="52-1THES-005-28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</li>
