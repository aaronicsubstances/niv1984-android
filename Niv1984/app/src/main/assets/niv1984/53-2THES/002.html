 <h3>2 Thessalonians 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-1">Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-2">not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-3">Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_1">1</a>]</sup> is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-4">He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-5">Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-6">And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-7">For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-8">And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-9">The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders,</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-10">and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-11">For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-12">and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-13">But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_2">2</a>]</sup> to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-14">He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-15">So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_3">3</a>]</sup> we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-16">May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-002-17">encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.</li>
