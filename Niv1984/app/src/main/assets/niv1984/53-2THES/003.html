 <h3>2 Thessalonians 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-1">Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-2">And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-3">But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-4">We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-5">May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-6">In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching <sup>[<a href="#footnote_270790527_1">1</a>]</sup> you received from us.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-7">For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-8">nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-9">We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-10">For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: "If a man will not work, he shall not eat."</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-11">We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are busybodies.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-12">Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-13">And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-14">If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel ashamed.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-15">Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-16">Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-17">I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.</li>
  <li id="53-2THES-003-18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</li>
