 <h3>1 Timothy 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-1">I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone--</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-2">for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-3">This is good, and pleases God our Savior,</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-4">who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-5">For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-6">who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-7">And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-8">I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-9">I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-10">but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-11">A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-12">I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-13">For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-14">And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-002-15">But women <sup>[<a href="#footnote_176555845_1">1</a>]</sup> will be saved <sup>[<a href="#footnote_176555845_2">2</a>]</sup> through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</li>
