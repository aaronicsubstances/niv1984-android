 <h3>1 Timothy 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-1">Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_1">1</a>]</sup> he desires a noble task.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-2">Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-3">not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-4">He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-5">(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-6">He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-7">He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-8">Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-9">They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-10">They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-11">In the same way, their wives <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_2">2</a>]</sup> are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-12">A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-13">Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-14">Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-15">if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-003-16">Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_3">3</a>]</sup> appeared in a body, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_4">4</a>]</sup> was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.</li>
