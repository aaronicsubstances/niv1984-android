 <h3>1 Timothy 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-1">The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-2">Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-3">They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-4">For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-5">because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-6">If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-7">Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-8">For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-9">This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-10">(and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-11">Command and teach these things.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-12">Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-13">Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-14">Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-15">Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.</li>
  <li id="54-1TIM-004-16">Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</li>
