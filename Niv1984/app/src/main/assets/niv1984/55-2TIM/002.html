 <h3>2 Timothy 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-1">You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-2">And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-3">Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-4">No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-5">Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-6">The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-7">Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-8">Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-9">for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-10">Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-11">Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-12">if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-13">if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-14">Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-15">Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-16">Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-17">Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-18">who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-19">Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_1">1</a>]</sup> and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-20">In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-21">If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-22">Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-23">Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-24">And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-25">Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-002-26">and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</li>
