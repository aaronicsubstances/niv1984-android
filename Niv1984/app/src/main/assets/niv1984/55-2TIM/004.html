 <h3>2 Timothy 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-1">In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-2">Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-3">For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-4">They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-5">But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-6">For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-7">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-8">Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-9">Do your best to come to me quickly,</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-10">for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-11">Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-12">I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-13">When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-14">Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-15">You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-16">At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-17">But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-18">The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-19">Greet Priscilla <sup>[<a href="#footnote_854534052_1">1</a>]</sup> and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-20">Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-21">Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.</li>
  <li id="55-2TIM-004-22">The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</li>
