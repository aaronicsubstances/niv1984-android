 <h3>Titus 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-1">Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness--</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-2">a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-3">and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-4">To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-5">The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup> elders in every town, as I directed you.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-6">An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-7">Since an overseer <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_2">2</a>]</sup> is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless--not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-8">Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-9">He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-10">For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-11">They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach--and that for the sake of dishonest gain.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-12">Even one of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons."</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-13">This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-14">and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-15">To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.</li>
  <li id="56-TIT-001-16">They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.</li>
