 <h3>Hebrews 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-1">We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-2">For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-3">how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-4">God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-5">It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-6">But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-7">You made him a little <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_1">1</a>]</sup> lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-8">and put everything under his feet." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_2">2</a>]</sup> In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-10">In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-11">Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-12">He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-13">And again, "I will put my trust in him." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_4">4</a>]</sup> And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-14">Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-15">and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-16">For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-17">For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_6">6</a>]</sup> the sins of the people.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-002-18">Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</li>
