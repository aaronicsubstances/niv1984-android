 <h3>Hebrews 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-1">Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-2">He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-3">Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-4">For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-5">Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-6">But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-7">So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice,</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-8">do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert,</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-9">where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-10">That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, `Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-11">So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-12">See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-13">But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-14">We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-15">As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-16">Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-17">And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-18">And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_3">3</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-003-19">So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</li>
