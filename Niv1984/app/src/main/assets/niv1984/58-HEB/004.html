 <h3>Hebrews 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-1">Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-2">For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-3">Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'" <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_2">2</a>]</sup> And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-4">For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-5">And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-6">It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-7">Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-8">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-9">There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-10">for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-11">Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-12">For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-13">Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-14">Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_5">5</a>]</sup> Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.</li>
  <li id="58-HEB-004-16">Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</li>
