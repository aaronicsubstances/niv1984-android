 <h3>James 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-1">My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-2">Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-3">If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet,"</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-4">have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-5">Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-6">But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-7">Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-8">If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup> you are doing right.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-9">But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-10">For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-11">For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_2">2</a>]</sup> also said, "Do not murder." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_3">3</a>]</sup> If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-12">Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-13">because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-14">What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-15">Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-16">If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-17">In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-18">But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-19">You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-20">You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_4">4</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-21">Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-22">You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-23">And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_5">5</a>]</sup> and he was called God's friend.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-24">You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-25">In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?</li>
  <li id="59-JAS-002-26">As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</li>
