 <h3>1 Peter 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-1">Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-2">Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-3">now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-4">As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him--</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-5">you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-6">For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-7">Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_2">2</a>]</sup> " <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-8">and, "A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_4">4</a>]</sup> They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-9">But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-10">Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-11">Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-12">Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-13">Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority,</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-14">or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-15">For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-16">Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-17">Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-18">Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-19">For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-20">But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-21">To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-22">"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-23">When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-24">He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</li>
  <li id="60-1PET-002-25">For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</li>
