 <h3>Revelation 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="66-REV-004-1">After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-2">At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-3">And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-4">Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-5">From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits <sup>[<a href="#footnote_238916283_1">1</a>]</sup> of God.</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-6">Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-8">Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-9">Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-10">the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:</li>
  <li id="66-REV-004-11">"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."</li>
