<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>to the church of God in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be saints, together with all who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I always give thanks to my God for you because of the grace of God that has been given to you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For you have been enriched in him in every way, in all speech and all knowledge,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>so that you are not lacking in any gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He will strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-h'><span>Divisions in the Church</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be knit together in the same mind and in the same purpose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For it has been disclosed to me about you, my brothers, by those of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul,” while another says, “I follow Apollos,” or, “I follow Cephas,” or, “I follow Christ.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>so that no one may say that I baptized into my own name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not recall if I baptized anyone else.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, and not with cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be deprived of its power.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-h'><span>Christ the Power and Wisdom of God</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Consider your calling, brothers, that not many of you were wise according to the flesh, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>God chose what is lowly and despised in the world, things that are regarded as nothing, to nullify the things that are regarded as something,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>so that no flesh might boast before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-35-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God, and in whom we have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-36-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-40-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-41-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>On the contrary, we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God foreordained for our glory before time began.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>None of the rulers of this age understood this wisdom, for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-50-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-52-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might understand what God has freely given us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-55-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But he who is spiritual makes judgments about all things, and yet he himself is not subject to any man's judgment.</span></div>
