<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth through the Spirit, resulting in genuine brotherly love, love one another deeply, from a pure heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the word of God that lives and abides forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For, “All flesh is like grass, and all the glory of man is like a flower of grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls,</span></div>
