<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-2-h'><span>Greeting</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not only I, but also all who know the truth—</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-h'><span>Walking in Truth and Love</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I was overjoyed to find some of yoʋr children walking in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now I ask yoʋ, dear lady—not as writing yoʋ a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard it from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For many deceivers have come into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Watch yourselves, so that we do not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Everyone who transgresses and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not greet him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>for whoever greets him takes part in his evil works.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-h'><span>Final Greetings</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be full.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The children of yoʋr chosen sister greet yoʋ. Amen.</span></div>
