<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>It is indeed right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>not to be quickly shaken from your understanding or alarmed by any spirit or message or by any letter supposedly from us alleging that the day of Christ has already come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Let no one deceive you in any manner, for that day cannot come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He will oppose and exalt himself above every so-called god and object of worship, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth and annihilate by the appearance of his coming.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the working of Satan, with all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs, and wonders,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and with every kind of wicked deception among those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For this reason God will send them a powerful delusion, leading them to believe what is false,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.</span></div>
