<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions, rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in everything he may be preeminent.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>At one time you were alienated from God and hostile in your minds because of your evil works. But now God has reconciled you to himself</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>through the death of Christ in his physical body, in order to bring you into his own presence as holy, unblemished, and above reproach,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, without shifting away from the hope of the gospel that you heard.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>I became a servant of the church according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>the mystery that has been hidden for ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-52-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He stripped the rulers and authorities of their power and made a public display of them, leading a triumphal procession over them by the cross.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-55-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Let no one who delights in false humility and angelic religion disqualify you. Such a person takes his stand on things he has not seen, being puffed up without reason by the mind of his flesh,</span></div>
