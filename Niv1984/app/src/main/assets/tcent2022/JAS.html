<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes who are scattered abroad: Greetings.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But he must ask in faith without doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The lowly brother should rejoice in being exalted,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>No one should say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God is not tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Of his own will he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and rampant wickedness, humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But be doers of the word and not hearers only. Otherwise, you are deceiving yourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For he looks at himself and goes away, and then immediately forgets what he looks like.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts. He will be blessed in what he does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>If anyone among you considers himself to be religious but does not bridle his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Pure and undefiled religion before God our Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-38-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Suppose a man in fine clothing comes into your assembly wearing a gold ring, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-40-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-41-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen the poor of the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-42-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Are they not the ones who drag you into court?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-43-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Do they not blaspheme the good name by which you are called?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-45-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-46-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For whoever keeps the entire law but stumbles in one point has become guilty of it all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who said, “Yoʋ shall not commit adultery,” also said, “Yoʋ shall not murder.” Now if yoʋ do not commit adultery but do commit murder, yoʋ have become a transgressor of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-49-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For judgment is without mercy to anyone who has not shown mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>What is the benefit, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-54-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>In the same way faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-55-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But someone will say, “Yoʋ have faith, and I have works.” Show me yoʋr faith by yoʋr works, and I, by my works, will show yoʋ my faith.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-59-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Do yoʋ see how faith was active along with his works, and by works his faith was brought to completion?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-60-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-61-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>You see then that a person is justified by works, and not by faith alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-62-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-63-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.</span></div>
