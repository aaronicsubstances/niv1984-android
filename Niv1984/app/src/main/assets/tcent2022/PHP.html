<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I am confident that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>It is right for me to think this way about you all, since I have you in my heart.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For God is my witness that I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I pray that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>so that you may approve what is excellent in order to be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually helped advance the gospel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>so that it has become known among the entire imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the greater part of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence through my imprisonment and are far more bold to speak the word without fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others do it out of good will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to add affliction to me in my imprisonment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But what does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But if I am to live in the flesh, it will mean fruit from my labor. Yet I do not know which I prefer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>I am hard pressed between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Only live as citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>and not being intimidated in any way by those who oppose you. For them this is an indication of destruction, but for you it is an indication of salvation, and that from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>since you are experiencing the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-46-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every other name,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-50-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, my beloved friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>for God is the one at work in you, granting you the will and power to do so, according to his good pleasure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-52-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Do everything without grumbling or arguing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-53-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-54-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>as you hold firmly to the word of life. Then I will have a reason to boast in the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-60-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For they all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-61-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But you know Timothy's proven character, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-62-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Therefore I hope to send him to you at once, as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-63-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-64-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But for now I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-65-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For he has been longing for you all and was distressed because you heard that he was sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-66-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Indeed he was sick, almost to the point of death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-67-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be less anxious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-68-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor men like him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-69-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>because he drew near to death for the work of Christ, disregarding his own life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</span></div>
