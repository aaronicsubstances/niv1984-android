<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that I continually remember you,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>that is, that while I am among you we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but have been hindered until the present time) so that I might have some fruit among you as well, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, both to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Because what is known about God is evident among them, for God has made it evident to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For his invisible qualities, both his everlasting power and his divinity, have been plainly seen from the creation of the world, being perceived through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their thoughts, and their senseless hearts were darkened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Claiming to be wise, they became fools</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>because they exchanged the truth of God for falsehood and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions, for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is contrary to nature.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>In the same way the men also, having abandoned the natural function of the female, were inflamed in their lust for one another, men committing shameful acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And just as they considered it worthless to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a worthless mind, to do what is not proper.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>They are filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, evil, covetousness, and malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and maliciousness. They are gossips,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-35-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but for those who are self-seeking and obey unrighteousness instead of the truth, there will be anger and wrath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-49-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>There will be tribulation and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-50-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For there is no partiality with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-52-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-53-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-54-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what is required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-55-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness with them and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-68-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he who is physically uncircumcised and carries out the law will judge yoʋ who, despite having the letter of the law and circumcision, transgress the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-69-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is circumcision something outward in the flesh;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-73-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>What then is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-74-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Much in every way. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-75-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now what if some of them were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify the faithfulness of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-76-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Certainly not! Rather, let God be true even if every man is a liar, just as it is written, “So that yoʋ may be justified in yoʋr words, and prevail when yoʋ are judged.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-77-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God, who inflicts wrath, unrighteous? (I speak in a human way.)</span></div>
