<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, appointed to further the faith of God's chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before time began;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>in his own time he revealed his word through the preaching with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>to Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The reason I left yoʋ in Crete was for yoʋ to put in order what remained to be done and to appoint elders in every town, as I directed yoʋ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>An elder must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who are not rebellious and cannot be accused of debauchery.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for sordid gain,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but hospitable, a lover of goodness, sensible, just, holy, and self-controlled,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision faction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They must be silenced, because they are ruining entire households by teaching what they ought not to teach, for the sake of sordid gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>One of their very own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may become sound in the faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>not paying any attention to Jewish myths or the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They profess to know God, but by their works they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient, and have proven themselves to be unqualified for any good work.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-43-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, and enslaved to various lusts and pleasures. Living in wickedness and envy, we were loathsome and hated one another.</span></div>
