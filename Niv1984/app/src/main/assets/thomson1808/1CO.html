<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>to the congregation of God which is at Corinth; to them who are hallowed by Christ Jesus; called to be holy, together with all those in every place who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>favour be to you, and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I thank my God always with respect to you, for the favour of God which is granted you by Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>that in every thing you have been enriched by him with all doctrine and with all knowledge,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>in the same manner as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>so that you are not deficient in any gift during your waiting for the full manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>who will confirm you to the end, exempt from accusation in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>God is faithful by whom you have been called to a fellowship in his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And I intreat you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same sentiment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I am informed respecting you, my brethren, by some of Chloe's family, that there are contentions among you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I mean this, that every one of you saith, I am for Paul; and I am for Apollos; and I for Cephas; and I for Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Is the Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized to the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>that none might say that I baptized to my own name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not recollect that I baptized any other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the glad tidings, not with wisdom of speech, that the cross of the Christ might not be rendered useless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For this doctrine (the doctrine of the cross) is foolishness to them who perish; but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and abolish the understanding of the prudent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Where is the wise? Where the scribe? Where the disputer of this age? Hath not God shewn the wisdom of this world to be folly?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For when, amidst the wisdom of God, the world did not, by means of that wisdom, know God; it pleased God by the foolishness of this proclamation to save them who believe;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>so when the Jews demand a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>as for us, we proclaim a crucified Christ; to the Jews indeed a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>but to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>because this foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and this weak thing of God is stronger than men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For observe, brethren, this call of you, that there are not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many of illustrious birth;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise; and the weak things of the world God hath made choice of to put to shame the strong</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>and the ignoble of this world, and those of no account, God hath chosen; nay, the very nothings, to put a stop to the operation of the things which are,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>that no flesh might boast in his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And it is owing to him that you are in Christ Jesus, who hath been made to us wisdom from God, namely, righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>so that as it is written, Let him who boasteth boast in the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now as for me, brethren, when I came to you, I did not come with a pomp of language or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>for I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ, even that crucified person; and</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>with regard to myself, I was among you in weakness and in fear, and in great trembling;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and my discourse and my proclamation was not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but we speak a mysterious wisdom of God that hidden (wisdom) which God determinately marked out for the benefit of the ages, to our glory</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>which none of the chiefs of this age knew (for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of the glory)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>things indeed, which as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived; which God hath prepared for them who love him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and which God hath revealed to us by his spirit. For this spirit searcheth all things, even the depths of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For who of mankind knoweth the things of a man, but only the spirit of the man which is in him? So no one knoweth the things of God, but the spirit of God only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now we have not received the spirit of this world, but the spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which God hath freely granted to us;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>which things we indeed speak, not in set words of human wisdom, but in the dictated words of a holy spirit, explaining spiritual things by spiritual words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now an animal man receiveth not those dictates of the spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot know them, because they are to be spiritually examined;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>but the spiritual man examineth all things, and is himself examined by no man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I fed you with milk, and not with strong food, because you were not arrived at strength; nor are you indeed yet strong, even now.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-79-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now that, which is principally required in a steward, is, that he be found faithful.</span></div>
