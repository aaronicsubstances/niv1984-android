<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When king David was old; far advanced in years, they covered him with clothes, but he was not warmed;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>therefore his servants said, Let a young virgin be sought out for the king, that she may attend him, and chafe him, and lie in his bosom, that my lord the king may be warmed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So they sought for a beautiful virgin, through all the borders of Israel, and having found Abisag, the Somanite, they brought her to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The young woman was indeed very beautiful, and she chafed the king, and waited on him, but the king knew her not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Adonias, son of Aggith, took upon him state, saying, I shall be king; and provided himself with chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And his father did not in the least restrain him nor say, Why hast thou done so? Now in person he was very comely, and by birth next after Abessalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And his plans were concerted with Joab, son of Saruia, and with Abiathar, the priest, and they abetted him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Sadok the priest, and Banaias, son of Jodae, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Resi, and the worthies of David, were not of his party.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So having slain sheep, and oxen, and lambs, at the fires of Zaelethi, which is near Rogel, Adonias invited all his brothers, and all the nobles of Juda, the king's servants;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but did not invite Nathan the prophet, nor Banaias, nor the worthies, nor Solomon his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Thereupon Nathan spoke to Bersabe, the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonias, son of Aggith, doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now therefore come, I pray thee, let me advise thee. Save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Go immediately to king David, and say to him, Didst thou not, my lord the king, swear to thy servant saying, Thy son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And behold whilst thou art speaking with the king, I will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So Bersabe went to the king, into the inner chamber. Now the king was very old, and Abisag the Somanite was waiting on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And when Bersabe had bowed down, and made obeisance to the king, the king said to her, What is thy will?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But me thy servant, and Sadok the priest, and Banaias, son of Jodae, and Solomon thy servant, he hath not invited.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And king David in reply said, Call Bersabe to me. And when she came in before the king, and stood in his presence,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>the king swore, saying, As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all affliction,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Thereupon Bersabe bowed down, with her face to the ground, and made obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then king David said, Call to me Sadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias, son of Jodae. And when they came in before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>he said to them, Take the servants of your lord the king with you, and mount my son Solomon on my mule, and conduct him down to Gion,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Sadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and having anointed Solomon, he blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted, Live king Solomon!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And Adonias, and all his guests, heard it just as they had done eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What is this sound of the city in an uproar?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when David's days drew near that he should die, he spoke to his son Solomon, and said,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>that the Lord may establish his word which he hath spoken, saying, If thy children take heed to their ways, to walk before me in truth, with their whole heart, thou shalt not, said he, have a man cut off from the throne of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-61-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now thou thyself knowest what Joab son of Saruia hath done to me; what he did to the two chiefs of the armies of Israel, to Abenner son of Ner, and to Amessai son of Jether.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-62-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Do thou therefore according to thy wisdom, so as not to let his grey hairs go down to the grave in peace.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-64-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Behold also thou hast with thee Semei, son of Gera, the Jeminite of Baurim.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-65-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now thou art not to hold him guiltless. As thou art a wise man, thou thyself therefore wilt know what to do to him, and wilt bring down his grey hairs to the grave with blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-66-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-67-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now all the days which David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years at Chebron, and thirty three years at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-68-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was well established;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-69-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Adonias, son of Aggith, went to Bersabe, the mother of Solomon, and bowed to her. Whereupon she said to him, Is thy coming peaceable? And he said, It is peaceable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-70-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I have something to say to thee. And she said to him, Say on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-71-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then he said to her, Thou knowest that the kingdom belonged to me, and that all Israel looked on me as king.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-72-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now therefore I have a favour to ask of thee, do not refuse it. And Bersabe said to him, Proceed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-73-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then he said to her, Speak, I pray thee to Solomon, for he will not refuse thee, that he may give me Abisag, the Somanite, for a wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-74-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Thereupon Bersabe said, Well, I will speak to the king for thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-75-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So Bersabe went to king Solomon, to speak to him concerning Adonias. And the king arose to meet her, and saluted her, and when he sat down on the throne, there was a throne set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-76-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and said to him, I have a small favour to ask of thee, do not refuse me. And the king said to her, Ask it, my mother, I will not reject thee</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-77-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then she said, I pray thee, let Abisag, the Somanite, be given to thy brother Adonias for a wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-78-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Whereupon king Solomon in reply to his mother, said, But why hast thou asked Abisag for Adonias? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother, and Abiathar is his priest, and Joab, son of Saruia, his captain general, and his friend.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-79-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me and more also, if Adonias hath not spoken this against his own life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-80-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now therefore as the Lord liveth, who hath prepared me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and hath made for me a house, as he hath spoken, Adonias shall this day be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-81-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias, son of Jodae, and he slew him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-82-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when Adonias was dead, on the very same day, the king said to Abiathar, Begone speedily to thy fields at Anathoth, for thou art this day a condemned man, but I will not put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and hast shared in all the afflictions with which my father was afflicted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-83-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being the priest of the Lord, so that the word of the Lord was fulfilled, which he spoke against the house of Eli at Selom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-84-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Now when the news came to Joab, son of Saruia, because he had been of Adonias' party, and not a follower of Solomon, therefore Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and took hold of the horns of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-85-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And when they told Solomon, saying, Joab hath fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and behold he hath hold of the horns of the altar, king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What is the matter with thee, that thou hast fled to the altar. Thereupon Joab said, Because I was afraid of thee, therefore I fled to the Lord. Then Solomon sent Banaias, son of Jodae, saying, Go, and kill him, and bury him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-86-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So Banaias, son of Jodae, went to Joab, to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come out. And Joab said, I will not go out, for I will die here. Upon which Banaias, son of Jodae, returned and told the king, saying, Thus did Joab say, and thus he answered me;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-87-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>and the king said to him, Go and do to him as he hath spoken. Kill him, and bury him, and take away this day, the blood which he shed without cause, from me and my father's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-88-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The Lord indeed hath turned the blood of his iniquity on his head. Because he fell upon two men more righteous, and better than himself, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, namely Abenner, son of Ner, the captain general of Israel, and Amessai, son of Jether, the captain general of Juda;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-89-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>therefore their blood is returned on his own head, and on the head of his seed forever. But on David, and his seed, and on his house, and his throne, let there be peace from the Lord forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-90-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>So Banaias, son of Jodae, went up, and fell upon Joab; and when he had slain him, he buried him, at his house in the wilderness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-91-2-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>and the king set Banaias, son of Jodae, over the army in his stead. Now the regal government was established at Jerusalem, and the king made Sadok the priest, the first priest, in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon, son of David, reigned over Israel and Juda at Jerusalem. And the Lord gave Solomon understanding, and comprehensive wisdom, and an enlargement of heart, like the sand on the sea shore; so that the knowledge of Solomon was enlarged far above the knowledge of all the ancients, and above all the wise men of Egypt. And he took the daughter of Pharao, and brought her to the eity of David, until he finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord, which he did first, and also the wall of Jerusalem round about. These he began, and finished in seven years; for he had seventy thousand men who carried burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone on the mountains. And Solomon made the sea, and its supporters, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain in the court. And over the brazen sea he built the turreted shelter for it, and cut a canal through the city of David. And when Pharao's daughter went up out of the city of David into her house, which he had built for her, he then built the citadel. And Solomon offered, every year, three whole burnt offerings, and peace offerings, on the altar which he built for the Lord, and he burned incense before the Lord, and finished the house. Now the chiefs who were set over the works of Solomon were three thousand six hundred. They superintended the people who performed the works. He built also Assour, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baithoron, and Ballath. But this was after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. After finishing these he built the cities above mentioned.

Thereupon these courtiers of his, said, In this manner thou shalt speak to the people saying, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's thigh.
