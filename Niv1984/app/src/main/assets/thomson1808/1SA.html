<h2 id='thomson1808-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a man of Armathaim-Sipha, of mount Ephraim, whose name was Elkana, son of Jeremeel, son of Eliu, son of Thoke, at Nasib -Ephraim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he had two wives. The name of the one was Anna, and the name of the other Phennana.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Phennana had children; but Anna had not a child. And this man went up, year after year, out of his city; from Armathaim, to worship, and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabbaoth, at Selom; for Eli and his two sons, Ophni and Phineas, the priests of the Lord, were there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his custom was, on the day when Elkana had offered sacrifices, he gave portions to his wife Phennana, and her children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and to Anna he gave one portion, because she had not a child. Nevertheless, Elkana loved Anna more than the other, though the Lord had shut up her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But because the Lord had not given her a child, such was her affliction and anxiety on the account of this, that she became disconsolate, because the Lord had shut up her womb, so as not to give her a child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Thus he acted, year after year, when he went up to the house of the Lord. And when she was become disconsolate, and was weeping, and did not eat,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Elkana her husband said to her, Anna! and she said to him, Here, my lord. And he said to her, What is the matter with thee, that thou weepest? And why dost thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Thereupon Anna rose up, after they had eaten at Selom, and stood before the Lord. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat at the door posts of the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And she being in bitterness of soul, prayed to the Lord, and wept sore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying, Adonai, Lord, Eloe Sabbaoth! If thou wilt look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and give thy handmaid a man child, I will dedicate him before thee, as a gift to the day of his death; and he shall not drink wine, nor fermented liquor, nor shall a razor come on his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And while she was continuing her prayer before the Lord, Eli the priest observed her mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When she spoke in her heart, her lips moved, but her voice was not heard, so Eli thought that she was drunk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Thereupon Eli's servant said to her, How long wilt thou be drunk? Take away thy wine, and depart from the presence of the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Anna answered, and said, No, my lord. I am a woman in deep affliction. I have not drunk wine nor strong drink; but am pouring out my soul before the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Count not thy handmaid a daughter of wickedness, because, out of the abundance of my deep meditation, I have continued till now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Eli in reply said to her, Go in peace. May the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And she said, Thy servant hath found favour in thy sight. Then the woman went away, and when she came to her lodging, she ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more dejected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they arose early in the morning, and worshipped the Lord, and set out on their journey. And when Elkana came to his house at Armathaim, he knew his wife Anna; and the Lord remembered her,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and she conceived, and at the appointed time bore a son, and called his name Samuel, because, said she, I asked him of the Lord God of Sabbaoth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And when the man Elkana went up, with his household, to offer at Selom his annual sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tythes of his land,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Anna did not go up with him; for she said to her husband, Not till the boy can go up after I have weaned him, that he may appear before the Lord, and abide there continually.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Elkana her husband said to her, Do what seemeth good in thine eyes. Stay till thou hast weaned him. And may the Lord establish what hath proceeded from thy mouth. So the woman staid at home, and suckled the child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when she had weaned him, she went up with her husband to Selom, with a bull of three years old, and bread, and an epha of fine flour, and a nebal of wine, and came to the house of the Lord at Selom, and the boy with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And when they had presented him before the Lord, and his father had slain the victim, which he offered yearly to the Lord, he presented the boy, and slew the bull, and Anna, the mother of the child, presented him before Eli, and said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Attend to me, my lord! As thy soul liveth, I am the woman who stood in thy presence with thee when I prayed to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted me the petition which I asked of him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>therefore I dedicate him to the Lord, all the days of his life, as a loan to the Lord. Then she said,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Because there is none holy like the Lord, And none is righteous like our God, There is none holy besides thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Boast not, nor speak haughtily, Let not arrogance proceed from your mouth. Because the Lord is a God of all knowledge; A God who prepareth his own designs;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The Lord will make his adversary weak. Holy is the Lord.

The Lord ascended up to heaven and thundered; He will judge the highest on earth: To our kings he giveth power, And he will exalt the horn of his anointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So she left the child there before the Lord, and returned to Armathaim; and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Eli the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now the sons of Eli the priest were wicked men. They did not know the Lord;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>but the servant of the priest would come when the flesh was boiling; and having a three pronged flesh fork in his hand, would strike it into the great cauldron, or into the brass kettle, or into the pot; and all that came up with the flesh fork the priest took for himself. In this manner they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the Lord at Selom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And before the suet was burned, the priest's servant would come, and say to the man who was sacrificing, Give me flesh to roast for the priest, for I will not take boiled flesh from thee out of the kettle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And if the man who was sacrificing said, Let the suet first be burned according to the ritual, then take for thyself any piece thy soul desireth; he would say, No; thou shalt give it me now.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So that the sin of these young men was very great before the Lord; because they set at naught the sacrifice of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-70-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when the child Samuel was ministering to the Lord before Eli the priest (in those days the word of the Lord was precious; there was no distinct vision)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-71-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>it came to pass at that time, when Eli was sleeping in his place, his eyes having then begun to be heavy, so that he could not see,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-199-9-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the asses of Kis, Saul's father, being lost, Kis said to his son Saul, Take with thee one of the servants, and arise, and go seek the asses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-201-9-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when they came to Siph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, Come, let us return, lest my father, forgetting the asses, be concerned for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-202-9-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Thereupon the servant said to him, Behold, I pray thee, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man in high repute.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-203-9-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Saul said to the servant who was with him, But behold, if we go what can we carry to the man of God?

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-204-9-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In reply to which the servant again said to Saul, Behold I have in my hand a quarter of a shekel of silver, thou shalt give that to the man of God, that he may tell us our way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-205-9-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now heretofore in Israel, when any one went to consult God, he spoke thus, Come let us go to the Seer; for the people in former times called the prophet, Seer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-207-9-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And as they were going up the ascent to the city, they met the women coming out to draw water, and said to them, Is the Seer here?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-210-9-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So they went up to the city, and as they were entering into the middle of the city, behold Samuel came out over against them with an intent to go up to the Bama.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-211-9-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now the Lord had made a revelation to Samuel, the day before Saul came to him, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-221-9-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So Saul dined, and went down that day with Samuel from the Bama to the city, and a bed being spread for him on the house top, he went to sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-222-9-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Samuel went up to him early in the morning, and called Saul on the house top and said, Arise, and I will dismiss thee.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-223-9-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And as they were going down to the border of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Order thy servant to go on before us; but stand thou still, and hear the word of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-787-28-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Whereupon David said to Angchus, Thus thou shalt now know what thy servant can do. And Angchus said to David, Thus will I make thee captain of my body guard during thy life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-793-28-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Thereupon Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothes, and went, he and two men with him.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-794-28-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the woman said to him, Behold thou knowest what Saul hath done; how he hath rooted out all the belly speakers, and the diviners, out of the land; why then dost thou lay a trap for my life, to put me to death?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-795-28-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Saul swore to her saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no mischief befal thee on this account.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-796-28-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up for thee? And when he had said, Bring up Samuel for me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-797-28-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>the woman saw Samuel, and cried with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, Why hast thou deceived me? Thou indeed art Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-798-28-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the king said to her, Fear not. Tell me, Whom hast thou seen? And the woman said to him, I saw gods coming up out of the earth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-800-28-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled me, that I should come up?

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-801-28-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Samuel said, Why dost thou ask me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is with thy neighbour?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-805-28-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>At this Saul shuddered, and fell at his full length on the ground, and was struck with horror at the words of Samuel, and there was no more any strength in him, for he had not eaten bread that whole day, and that whole night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-806-28-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was in great trepidation, she said to him, Behold I pray thee, thy servant hath hearkened to thy voice.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-807-28-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>now therefore, hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thy servant, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat that thou mayst have strength; for thou art to travel.</span></div>
