<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians in God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Favour be to you, and peace, from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>remembering incessantly the work of your belief, and the labour of your love, and the perseverance of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of our God and Father;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>knowing, brethren beloved of God, the choice made of you</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>that our glad tidings did not come to you in word only, but with power, and with a holy spirit, and with much assurance. As you knew what manner of persons we were among you</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>for your sakes, you indeed became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having embraced the word in much affliction, with the joy of a holy spirit;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>so that you became patterns for all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For from you the word of the Lord hath been sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia; but, in every place, your belief in God is spread to such a degree, as rendereth it unnecessary for us to say any thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For they themselves relate concerning us what an entrance we had among you; and how you turned to God from the idols, to serve the living and true God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, namely Jesus, who delivered! us from the wrath to come</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For you, brethren, yourselves know that entrance of ours among you, that it was not in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Though we indeed had suffered before, and had been treated injuriously, as you know, at Philippi; we had the courage, by the help of our God, to declare to you the glad tidings of God with much earnestness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For our exhortation did not proceed from error, nor from impurity; nor was it with deceit;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>but as we had been approved by God to be entrusted with the glad tidings, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who trieth our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For never did we at any time use flattering words, as you know; nor a pretext for covetousness, God is witness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>nor were we seeking human glory either from you or from others. We might have appeared with weight as Christ's apostles;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but we were gentle among you. Our affectionate regard for you being such, as that with which a nursing mother would cherish her own children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>we were willing to impart to you not only the glad tidings of God, but even our own lives, because you were dear to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For you, brethren, remember our labour and our toil: for working day and night that we might not be burthensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the glad tidings of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You are witnesses, and God is witness, how holy, how just, how irreproachable our behaviour was to you who believed</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>how, as you know, we exhorted every one of you, as a father would his children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>exhorting you, and comforting you, and testifying that you should walk worthy of God who inviteth you to his kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>On this account also we give thanks to God continually, because, when you received from us this message of God, you embraced it, not as a word of men, but, as it really is, a word of God, which operateth with powerful effect in you who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For you, brethren, became imitators of the congregations of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. Because you suffered from your countrymen the same treatment as they did from the Jews</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>(from those indeed who slew the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and persecuted us, and who please not God, and are in opposition to all men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>hindering us from speaking to the nations that they may be saved; thus, filling up the measure of their sins continually: but the wrath is at last coming upon them,)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>therefore we brethren, being torn from you for a short time in person, not in heart, did the more earnestly endeavour to see your face. Having therefore a longing desire,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>we wished to come to you, (particularly I Paul) once and again, but Satan obstructed us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is our hope, or will be our joy, or crown of rejoicing? Will it not be you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For you are our glory and our joy.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Wherefore not being able to bear any longer, we acquiesced in being left alone in Athens,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and sent Timothy our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow labourer in the glad tidings of the Christ, to establish you and comfort you concerning your belief;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>that none of you might be staggered by those afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>now may he himself, our God and father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>that every one of you know how to use his own vessel in sanctification and honour;</span></div>
