<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-872-36-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Joachaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Amital. She was a daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. And Pharao Nechao bound him at Deblatha in the land of Aimath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-873-36-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king carried him with him to Egypt, and imposed on the country a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-874-36-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Pharao Nechao, made Eliakim son of Josias, king over Juda, in the room of his father, and changed his name to Joakim. And as Pharao Nechao took his brother Joachaz, who was carried to Egypt and died there, he paid the silver and the gold to Pharao. Then the land began to be taxed to give the money at the command of Pharao. And every one according to his rank, demanded silver and gold from the people of the land, to pay Pharao Nechao.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-875-36-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Joakim was twenty five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Zechora. She was a daughter of Nerias of Rama. And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. In his days Nabuchodonosar, the king of Babylon, came into the land, and he was his servant three years, and then revolted. Now after that, when they revolted, the Lord sent against them the Chaldeans, and predatory bands of Syrians, and predatory bands of Moabites and Ammonites, and of Samaria according to the word of the Lord by the ministry of his servants, the prophets. Moreover the anger of the Lord was against Juda, to remove them from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses; for all that he had committed and for the innocent blood which Joakim had shed. He had indeed filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, yet the Lord was not willing to destroy them utterly.</span></div>
