<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Favour be to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who comforteth us in all our affliction, to the end that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves have been comforted by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Because in proportion as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us, so by means of Christ our consolation also aboundeth;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and whether we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectually wrought out by a patient enduring of the same sufferings which we suffer; or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>therefore our hope of you is stedfast, as we know, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so will you be also of the consolation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For we do not, brethren, wish you to be ignorant with respect to that affliction of ours which befel us in Asia; that we were exceedingly pressed beyond our strength, so that we had indeed no hopes of life;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>but had in ourselves the sentence of death, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will still deliver us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>you joining the assistance of your prayers for us, that the favour granted to us for the sake of many may be acknowledged by many with thanksgiving on our behalf.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For this is the matter of our boasting; the testimony of our conscience, that with simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more especially towards you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For we write nothing to you but what you clearly understand or have acknowledged, and will, I hope, even to the end acknowledge,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>as some of you have acknowledged us, that we are your boast, as you indeed will be ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And in this confidence I purposed to come to you first, that you might have a second benefit;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and through you to proceed on to Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come to you again, and be by you forwarded on to Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Did I then, in purposing this, use fickleness? Or what I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there may be the yes, yes; and the no, no?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now as God is faithful, our word to you was not yes and no.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Son of God, namely Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by us namely by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yes and no; but by him hath been made yes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For all the promises of God are in him yes, and in him Amen, for glory to God through us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now, he who keepeth us together with you firm for Christ, and anointed us, is God,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>but I determined this with myself, that my coming again should not be the occasion of grief to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if I grieve you, who is there to gladden me? None, but he whom I have made sorrowful:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and I wrote to you for this 'very purpose, that, when I come, I may not have grief on account of them for whom I ought to rejoice; as I have a confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For in great affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know that overflowing love which I have for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now if any one hath occasioned grief, he hath grieved me only as a partner in it; that I may not continue a burden on you all;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>sufficient for such a one is the censure which hath been passed by the majority;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>so that, on the contrary, I rather wish you to forgive and comfort him, that such a one may not be overwhelmed with an excess of sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore I intreat you to authorise love for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For this was one purpose of my writing, that I might have this proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And to whomsoever you forgive any thing, I do so too. For with regard to myself, if I have forgiven any one whatever any thing, I have forgiven him for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>that Satan may not get an advantage over us, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now when I came to Troas for the purpose of proclaiming the glad tidings of the Christ, though the Lord opened a door for me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus; but taking leave of them, I set out for Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But thanks be to God who causeth us always to triumph in the Christ, and who manifesteth by us, in every place, the odour of the knowledge of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Because we are for God a strong odour of the Christ among them who are saved, and among them who perish</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>(to these indeed an odour of death for death, but to those an odour of life for life) who therefore is sufficient for this?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Such is the confidence which we have through Christ in regard to God;</span></div>
