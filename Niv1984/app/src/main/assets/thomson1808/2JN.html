<h2 id='thomson1808-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The elder to Electa Cyria and her children whom in truth I love (and not only I, but all who have known the truth)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>on account of the truth which abideth in us, and will be with us for ever:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>with you be favour, mercy, peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I was greatly rejoiced because I found some of thy children walking in truth, as we received a commandment from the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And I now intreat thee, Cyria, not as writing to thee a new commandment; but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and this love is that we may walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you may walk therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Because there are many deceivers come into the world, who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ is come in flesh. (This is the deceiver, and the Antichrist)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Look to yourselves, that we may not lose our labour, but that we may receive ample wages.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of the Christ, hath not God. He who abideth in the doctrine of the Christ hath both the Father and the Son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If any one cometh to you, and doth not bring this doctrine, receive him not into your family; nor wish him success;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>for he who wisheth him success is a partaker with him in his evil works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Having many things to write to you, I determined not to commit them to paper and ink; but I hope to come to you, and deliver them by word of mouth, that our joy may be complete.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The children of thy sister Electa salute thee. Amen.</span></div>
