<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the death of Achab, Moab broke covenant with Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and Ochozias fell through the lattice in his upper chamber at Samaria, and was sick, whereupon he sent messengers, saying to them, Go and inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron, whether I shall recover from this sickness of mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when they set out to inquire of him, the angel of the Lord called Elias the Thesbite, and said, Arise and go, meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that you are going to inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now is not this the case, saith the Lord, From the bed to which thou art gone up thou shalt not come down, for thou shalt assuredly die?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So Elias went and spoke to them, and the messengers returned to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Thereupon he said to them, Why are you returned? To which they replied, There came up a man to meet us, and he said to us, Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou goest to inquire of Baal, the fly-god of Akkaron? Now is not this the case; From the bed to which thou hast gone up thou shalt not come down, for thou shalt assuredly die?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now when they who returned told the king what Elias had said, he said to them, What sort of a man was he who came up to meet you, and spoke these words to you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they said to him, He was a hairy man, girt about the loins with a leathern girdle. Upon which he said, This is Elias the Thesbite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty, who went up to him. Now behold Elias was sitting on the top of the mount. And when the captain spoke to him and said, Man of God, the king hath sent for thee, come down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Elias, in reply, said to the captain, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. So there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But the king persisted, and sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And the captain spoke to him and said, Man of God, thus saith the king, Come down quickly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Whereupon Elias in reply, said to him, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. Accordingly there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Still the king persisted, and sent another captain and his fifty. But when the third captain came he fell upon his knees before Elias, and with entreaties addressed him, saying, man of God, let my life and the lives of thy servants, these fifty, be precious in thy sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Behold, fire hath come down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty; but now let my life, I beseech thee, be precious in thy sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, and said, Go down with him; be not afraid of them. So Elias arose and went down with him to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Elias spoke to him and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why didst thou send messengers to inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron? Is not this the case? From the bed to which thou hast gone up thou shalt not come down: for thou shalt assuredly die?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So he died according to the word of the Lord, which Elias spake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, behold are they not written in the book of the journal of the kings of Israel? And Joram son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria, twelve years, commencing in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not in the manner his brothers, nor as his mother had done. He indeed removed the pillars of Baal which his father had erected, and broke them to pieces. Nevertheless he adhered to the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin, and did not depart from them. Therefore the Lord was provoked to wrath against the house of Achab.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when the Lord was about to take up Elias as it were with a whirlwind into heaven, Elias went with Elisha from Galgala.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now Elias had said to Elisha, Tarry here I pray thee, for God hath sent me to Baithel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went to Baithel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the sons of the prophets who were at Baithel, came to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that the Lord will take thy master to-day from over thy head?

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Elias said to Elisha, Tarry here I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, I will not forsake thee. So they went to Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, came to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that to-day the Lord will take away thy master from over thy head? And he said, I indeed know it; hold your peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Elias said to him, Tarry here I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to the Jordan. But Elisha replied, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they both proceeded on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And fifty men, sons of the prophets stood over against them at a distance when they two stopped at the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Elias took his mantle and having rolled it up, he smote the water, and the water parted this way and that, so that they both crossed on dry ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had crossed, Elias said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken up from thee.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Elias said, Thou hast put me to a stand by this request. If thou seest me taken up from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not; it cannot be granted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And as they proceeded on conversing as they went, behold a chariot of fire, with horses of fire, made a separation between them; and Elias was carried up with a whirlwind as it were into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Elisha saw and cried with a loud voice, My father! my father! The chariot of Israel and the driver thereof! And when he saw him no more, he took hold of his garment and rent it in two pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then he took up the mantle of Elias which fell from on high, and on his return back, he stood on the bank of the Jordan,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and took the mantle of Elias which had fallen from him, and smote the water and said, Where is the God of Elias now! And when he had smitten the waters they parted this way and that, so Elisha crossed over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elias hath rested on Elisha, so they went to meet him, and made obeisance to him by bowing to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then they said to him, Behold there are with thy servants fifty valiant men. Let them, we pray thee, go and seek thy master. Perhaps a blast of the Lord hath lifted him up and cast him by the Jordan, either on one of the mountains, or one of the hills. And Elisha said, You shall not send.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But when they pressed him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. So they sent fifty men. And when they had searched three days, but did not find him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>they returned to Elisha, who abode at Jericho. And Elisha said to them, Did I not tell you, you should not go?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold the situation of the city is good as our lord seeth, but the water is bad and the ground barren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Thereupon Elisha said to them, Bring me a new pitcher and put salt therein. And when they had got one and brought it to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Elisha went to the spring of the waters, and threw the salt in there and said, Thus saith the Lord, I cure the waters. There shall no more be thence death or barren ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So the waters were healed, and continue so to this day, according to the word which Elisha spoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then he went up thence to Baithel, and as he was going up he met in the way, little boys who had come out of the city, and who mocked him saying, Ascend bald head! Ascend!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And looking back upon them, he beheld them, and denounced a curse against them, in the name of the Lord. And behold there came two bears from the forest, and they tore forty two of the boys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Thence he went to mount Karmel, and thence returned to Samaria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Joram son of Achab, began his reign in Israel in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and reigned twelve years,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now Mosa king of Moab, was a Noked one who paid tribute in sheep and rebelliously withheld from the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with the wool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And it happened that after the death of Achab, when the king of Moab broke covenant with Israel,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then he said, Which way must I go up? To which he answered, By the way to the wilderness of Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So the king of Israel and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went out and took a circuit of seven days, and there was no water for the army nor for the cattle which attended them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And when the king of Israel said, Alas! for the Lord hath called the three kings who have come thus far, to deliver them into the hand of Moab;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Josaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel, with Josaphat king of Juda and the king of Edom, went down to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-62-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>To which Elisha replied, As the Lord of hosts liveth in whose presence I stand, were it not that I respect the person of Josaphat king of Juda, I would not look on thee nor see thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-63-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But now bring me a musician. And when the musician played, the hand of the Lord came upon him,</span></div>
