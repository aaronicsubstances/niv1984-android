<h2 id='thomson1808-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them who have obtained a like precious belief with us, in the saving goodness of our God and saviour Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>favour be to you, and may peace be multiplied by an acknowledgment of God, and of Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>As his divine power hath freely granted those things conducive to life and godliness, and all are ours by our acknowledging him who hath called us by glory and virtue,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>through which he hath freely made us very great and precious promises, that by them you may become partakers of a divine nature when you have fled from the corruption which is in the world by lust;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>therefore, having on your part used all diligence for the very same purpose, add to your faith fortitude; and to fortitude, knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, perseverance; and to perseverance, piety;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and to piety, brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection, universal love;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>for these being in you, and abounding, dispose you to be neither idle nor unfruitful for the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>for he who is without these is blind, having closed his eyes, having contracted a forgetfulness of the purification of his past sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore, brethren, use the more diligence to make your call and election sure; for if you practise these you will never fall;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>for thus there will further be administered to you, bounteously, the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For this purpose I will not neglect to put you always in mind of these things, though you already know them, and are established in the present truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Indeed I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by admonition;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>as I know that I must soon lay aside this tabernacle of mine, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath plainly shewed me;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and I will use all diligence that you may be able, every one of you, to recollect these things after my departure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For we indeed did not follow artfully contrived fables when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; but were ourselves eye witnesses of his majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For he was receiving honour and glory from God the Father, when a voice was uttered to him, from the transcendent glory, This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>This voice we ourselves actually heard uttered from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Therefore we have a more complete confirmation of the prophetic word, to which you do well in giving attention, as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn, and the bringer of light rise in your hearts;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture explaineth itself,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>for prophecy was not uttered in former days at the will of man; but the holy men of God spoke by an impulse of the holy spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be also among you false teachers, who will introduce destructive sects, denying even the Lord who bought them, bringing on themselves speedy destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And many will follow their pernicious courses, on the account of whom the way of the truth will be ill spoken of.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Indeed, with insatiable covetousness, they will, with smooth words, make merchandize of you. But the judgment prepared of old for them is not idle, nor is their destruction slumbering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For if God spared not angels who sinned, but confining them in Tartarus, chains of darkness, delivered them up to be kept for judgment</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and if he spared not the old world, but preserved eight persons, including Noah, the proclaimer of righteousness, when he brought a deluge on the world of ungodly men</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and when he condemned to destruction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, reducing them to ashes, and making them a publick example to future impious men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>delivered just Lot, who was troubled at the lascivious conduct of those licentious men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>(for at the sight and report, that righteous man who dwelt among them was daily tormented in soul by their unlawful deeds)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from, temptation, and to reserve the wicked to the day of judgment, to be punished;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and more especially them who go after flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and despise authority. Being audacious, and self sufficient they tremble not when they revile glories;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>whereas angels who are greater in might and power, do not bring against them a railing accusation before the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But these, like irrational brute beasts, made for capture and destruction, railing at what they are ignorant of, shall perish with their own destruction. 13 Receiving wages of iniquity, esteeming riot by day a pleasure; being spots and blemishes; rioting by their deceits; banquetting with you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>---</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>having eyes full of adultery and unceasing sin; ensnaring unstable souls; having a heart practised in greediness; an execrable race;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>having forsaken the right road they have gone quite astray, following the way of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and was convicted of his transgression. (A dumb beast, speaking with a human voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They are wells without water; clouds impelled by a whirlwind, for whom is reserved in the bowels of the earth the gloom of everlasting darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For uttering, with a solemn tone, swelling words of vanity, they by the lusts of the flesh. by acts of lasciviousness, ensnare them who are indeed flying from those conversant in error;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>promising them liberty while they themselves are slaves to corruption; for by whatever one is subdued, by that he is enslaved</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For if alter fleeing from the pollutions of the world by an acknowledgment of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, any are again entangled and overcome by them, the last state of such persons is worse than the first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But it hath happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is returned to his vomit, and the washed hog to its wallowing slough.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>This, my beloved, is now the second letter which I am writing, with which I stir up your sincere mind by way of remembrance,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>that you may remember the predictions of the holy prophets, and the injunction of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>knowing this first, that in the last day scoffers will come, walking after their own desires,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this they wilfully forget, that by the word of God there were heavens of old, and an earth consisting of water and in water,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>by which the world that then existed, being deluged, was destroyed;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but the heavens and the earth which now exist are, by the same word, treasured up for fire, being kept for the day of judgment, and destruction of these impious men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now let not this one thing, my beloved, escape you, That with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The Lord is not slack with regard to his promise, as some reckon slackness. But he is long suffering towards us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to a reformation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now the day of the Lord will come, as a thief at night, when the heavens with a crashing roar shall pass away, and the elements shall be dissolved by fire, and the earth, and all the works thereon, shall be burned up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-59-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore as all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness,</span></div>
