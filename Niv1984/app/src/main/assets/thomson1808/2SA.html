<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now after the death of Saul when David returned from the slaughter of the Amelekites, and had been at Sekelak two days,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>behold there came a man, on the third day, from the camp; from the people of Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head, and when he came to David he fell on the ground, and made obeisance to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And David said to him, Whence comest thou? And he replied, I have escaped from the camp of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Thereupon David said to him, What is the news? Tell me. And when he said, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people have fallen, and died; Saul also is dead, and his son Jonathan;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>David said to the young man who told him, How knowest thou that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the young man who told him said, By accident I happened to be on mount Gelbua, and behold Saul was leaning on his spear; and lo! the chariots and horsemen were close upon him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and when he looked back and saw me, he called me: and I said, Here I am.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then he said to me, Who art thou? and I said, I am an Amelekite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he said to me, Stand over me, I pray thee, and kill me; for I am seized with a gloomy horror, because all my life is in me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So I went up to him and killed him, for I am sure he could not live after he fell; and I took the crown which was on his head, and the bracelet which was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then David took hold of his garments, and rent them, and all the men who were with him rent their garments,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and beat their breasts, and wept, and fasted till evening for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they had been smitten with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And David said to the young man who told him, Whence art thou? And he said, I am the son of a stranger; an Amelekite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And David said to him, How couldst thou not be afraid to lift up thy hand to kill the Lord's anointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then David called one of his young men and said, Go near and fall upon him. So he smote him that he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy own head, for thy own mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then David sung this funereal Ode over Saul, and over Jonathan his son,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and gave orders that the children of Juda should learn it. Behold it is written in the book Straight.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>On you, mountains of Gelbua, let not dew descend; On you, let there be no rain, nor fields of first fruit offerings!

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>From the blood of the wounded; From the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan recoiled not empty; The sword of Saul bended not in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Saul and Jonathan were beloved; They were lovely and inseparable; Comely in their life; And in their death they were not divided.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who adorned your dress with scarlet; Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now after these things David inquired of the Lord saying, May I go up to one of the cities of Juda? And the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go? And he said, To Chebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So David went up to Chebron, with his two wives, Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia late the wife of Nabal, the Carmelite,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and the men who were with him, every one with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Chebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the men of Judea came, and anointed David there, to be king over the house of Juda. And when they told David, saying, The men of Jabis Galaad have buried Saul,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>David sent messengers to the leaders of Jabis Galaad, and said unto them, Blessed are ye of the Lord, because you have shewn this kindness for your lord; for Saul, the anointed of the Lord; and have buried him and his son Jonathan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now therefore may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with you! As for me I will recompense you for this kindness, because you have done this thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now therefore let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Juda have anointed me to be king over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Abenner, son of Ner, Saul's captain general, took Jebosthe, the son of Saul, and brought him from the camp to Manaem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and made him king over Galaaditis, and over Thasiri, and over Jezrael, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jebosthe the son of Saul, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and when he had reigned two years, (except over the house of Juda who followed David;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>now the time which David reigned at Chebron over the house of Juda was seven years and six months)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Abenner, son of Ner, and the servants of Jebosthe, son of Saul, came out from Manaem to Gabaon;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and Joab, son of Saruia, and the servants of David went out from Chebron, and they met each other at the pool of Gabaon, and sat down one on one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Abenner said to Joab, let the young men, I pray thee, arise and shew feats before us. And Joab said, let them arise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then there arose, and went over by number, twelve Benjaminites who were for Jebosthe, son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and they seized, every one with his hand, the head of his fellow, and plunged each his sword into his adversary's side, and fell together.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the battle became very furious that day. And Abenner, with the men of Israel, retreated before the servants of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now there were there three sons of Saruia, Joab, and Abessa and Asael. And Asael was swift of foot as a wild roe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Asael pursued Abenner, and turned not aside to the right, nor to the left from following him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Abenner looked back and said, Art thou Asael? And he said, I am.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Abenner said to him, Turn thee to the right, or to the left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take his armour. But Asael would not turn aside from following him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Abenner again said to Asael, Desist from following me, that I may not smite thee to the ground.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But he would not desist. So Abenner smote him with a back stroke of his spear, into the loin, and the spear passed quite through him, and he fell there and died under him. And every one who came to the place where Asael fell and died, stood still.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But Joab and Abessa continued the pursuit after Abenner, and as the sun was setting they had got as far as the hill Amman, which is in front of Gai, on the way to the wilderness of Gabaon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the Benjaminites who followed Abenner crouded together, and having formed themselves into one body, they stood on the summit of a hill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Abenner called to Joab, and said, Must the sword devour to a complete victory? Knowest thou not that in the last extremity it will be very bitter? How long shall it be ere thou command the people to return from pursuing our brethren?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Whereupon Joab said, As the Lord liveth, but for thy speech the people might, from the morning, have gone up every one from the pursuit of his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Joab sounded a trumpet and the people halted, and did not pursue Israel, nor continue the battle longer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-59-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And Abenner and his men bent their course homeward that whole night, and having crossed the Jordan and passed over the adjoining plain, they came to the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And when Joab returned from pursuing Abenner, and had assembled all the people, there were missing of David's servants nineteen men, including Asael.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-61-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But the servants of David had smitten of the children of Benjamin, even of Abenner's men, three hundred and sixty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-62-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then they took up Asael, and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. And Joab and the men who were with him, marched all night, and arrived at Chebron by break of day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-65-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Though the war was lengthened out between the house of Saul and the house of David, yet the house of David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-66-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For David had sons born to him in Chebron. His first born was Amnon, the son of Achinaam, the Jezraelitess;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-70-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But while the war continued between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abenner got a mastery over the house of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-71-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Saul had a concubine named Respha, a daughter of Jol. And Jebosthe the son of Saul, said to Abenner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-72-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For this Abenner was exceedingly enraged at Jebosthe, and said to him, Am I a dog's head?

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-75-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So Jebosthe could no more controul Abenner in any thing, because he was afraid of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-76-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Abenner sent messengers to David at Thailam where he was, in all haste, saying, Make a covenant with me, and behold my hand shall be with thee, to bring over all the house of Israel to thee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-78-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then David sent messengers to Jebosthe, son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I espoused at the price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-728-24-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when David arose in the morning, a word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-731-24-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Thereupon David said to Gad, I am in great straits on every side.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-740-24-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>All these Orna hath given to the king. And may the Lord thy God, said Orna addressing the king, bless thee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-742-24-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered whole burnt offerings and peace offerings.
