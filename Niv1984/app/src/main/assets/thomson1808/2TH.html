<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Favour be to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is fit; because your faith increaseth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all towards one another aboundeth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So that we ourselves boast of you in the congregations of God, on account of your perseverance and belief, in all your persecutions. Indeed by these afflictions which you endure</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>there is a clear evidence of the righteous judgment of God that you are accounted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you, actually suffer;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>since it is just with God to retribute affliction to them who afflict you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and to you who are afflicted, rest with us at the manifestation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>executing, with flaming fire, vengeance on them who know not God, and on them who hearken not to the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>These shall suffer punishment, an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>on the day when he shall come to be glorified by his saints, and to be admired by all those who believe that he was intrusted with this testimony of ours to you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>for which purpose we are continually praying for you, that our God would make you worthy of this invitation, and confirm all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith, with power;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the favour of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>we beseech you, brethren, not to be hastily shaken from your purpose; nor alarmed by any spirit, or by any word, or by any letter as from us, as if the day of the Christ was at hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Let no one by any means deceive you that it is, until the apostacy hath first come, and the man of sin hath been revealed: that son of perdition</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who setteth himself against, and exalteth himself above, all that is called God, or an object of worship; so as to seat himself as God in the temple of God, pointing himself out that he is God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For the mystery of this iniquity is now in operation, but there is one who yet restraineth. When he is out of the way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>then will be revealed that lawless one, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of his mouth. With the brightness of his coming he will indeed put a stop to the operations</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and with all the deceit of this unrighteousness among them who perish. Because they did not embrace the love of the truth that they might be saved;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>for this cause therefore God will send them the energy of delusion, that they may believe this falsehood;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>that all may be condemned who have not believed the truth, but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath, from the beginning, chosen you for salvation by a sanctification of spirit and a belief of the truth</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>to which he hath called you by our glad tidings, to be an acquisition of glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and keep firm hold of the doctrines which you have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>nor eat any man's bread for nothing; but with labour and toil worked night and day, that we might not be burthensome to any of you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>not because we are destitute of authority, but that we might exhibit ourselves as a pattern for you to imitate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For when we were with you we gave you this charge, that he who would not work should not eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For we hear that there are some among you who walk disorderly, doing no work, but busying themselves impertinently.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now we charge such, and intreat them by the Lord Jesus Christ, to work quietly, and eat their own bread.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Yet count him not an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And may the Lord of peace himself grant you peace continually in every respect. The Lord be with you all.</span></div>
