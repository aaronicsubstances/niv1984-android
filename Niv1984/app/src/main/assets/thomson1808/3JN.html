<h2 id='thomson1808-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom in truth I love</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Beloved, I wish thee health and prosperity in all things, as thy soul prospereth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For I was greatly rejoiced at the coming of the brethren, who bear testimony to thy truth, as thou walkest in truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Beloved, thou actest as a believer, in what thou dost for the brethren, and for the strangers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>who have borne testimony for thy love, in the presence of the congregation whom thou wilt do well to forward on in their journey in a manner worthy of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>for they have gone forth for his name's sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We therefore ought to entertain such, that we may be fellow helpers in the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I wrote to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who affecteth a preeminence among them, doth not regard us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For this cause, when I come I will take notice of his works which he doth, talking lightly of us with malicious words, and not content with this, he doth not entertain the brethren himself, and them who would, he hindereth, and casteth them out of the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who doth good is of God. But he who doth evil, hath not seen God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Demetrius hath a good testimony from all, and from the truth; and even we ourselves bear testimony for him; and you know that our testimony is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I had many things to write, but I do not choose to write to thee with ink and pen;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>but I hope to see thee soon, when we shall speak face to face. Peace be with thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</span></div>
