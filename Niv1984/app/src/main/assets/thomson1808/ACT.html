<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>till the day when he was taken up, after giving a charge by the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and to whom he had, after his suffering, shewn himself to be alive, by many proofs, during forty days appearing to them, and speaking of what concerned the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then assembling them together, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard from me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in a Holy Spirit not many days hence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When they therefore were come together they asked him, saying, Lord, art thou at this time about to restore the kingdom to Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Whereupon he said to them, It is not for you to know times and seasons which the Father hath reserved in his own disposal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit is come upon you; and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the remotest part of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And having said this, while they were beholding him he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And as they continued looking stedfastly up to heaven, while he was going, behold! two men stood near them, robed in white,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>who addressed them, saying, Men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up to heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same manner as you have seen him going to heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when they came in, they went up into the upper room, where Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James, usually made their abode.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>These all continued with one mind in prayer and supplication, with the women, particularly Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And in those days Peter rising up in the midst of the disciples, (the number of persons assembled being about one hundred and twenty)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>said, Men, brethren, It was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit predicted, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to them who laid hold on Jesus;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>because he was numbered with us, and had a part of this service allotted him</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and this was so generally known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that the field is called in their language, Akeldama, that is field of blood)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>for it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his fold be desolate, and let there be no inhabitant therein. And, His office let another take;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>It is necessary therefore, that one of these men who have accompanied us, during all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out over us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>beginning from the baptism of John to the day on which he was taken up from us, should be a witness with us of his resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So they set up two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And having prayed, saying, Thou, O Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, shew which of these two thou hast chosen</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>to take the share of this ministration and apostleship which Judas abandoned to go to his own place,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>they cast lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span></div>
