<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, Nabuchodonosar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord delivered into his hand Joakim king of Juda and a part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried to the land of Sennaar to the house of his god: and having deposited the vessels in the treasure house of his god,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>the king ordered Asphanez his high chamberlain to bring in of the children of the captivity of Israel, namely, of the seed royal and of the nobility,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>some youths who had no blemish, and who were of a good countenance, studious of every science, improved in knowledge and understanding and qualified to stand in the house before the king; and to instruct them in the learning and language of the Chaldeans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king ordered them a daily allowance from the king's table, and of the wine for his own drinking; and that they should be dieted for three years and after that stand before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now there were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel and Ananias and to Azarias and Misael;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and the high chamberlain gave them names, to Daniel, Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach; and Azarias, Abdenago.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Daniel having resolved not to pollute himself with the table of the king nor with the wine which he drank, intreated the chamberlain that he might not be defiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and compassion with the high chamberlain,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>therefore the chamberlain said to Daniel, I am afraid of my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink. Perhaps he may see your countenance more uncomely than the youths of your age, and you may endanger my head with the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Thereupon Daniel said to Amelsad, whom the high chamberlain had set over Daniel, Ananias, Misael and Azarias,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Try thy servants, we pray thee, ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and let our countenances and the countenances of the youths who eat of the king's table be examined in thy presence; and, as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he hearkened to them and tried them ten days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And at the end of the ten days their countenances appeared more comely and their flesh firmer than that of the youths, who had eaten of the king's table;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>whereupon Amelsad took away the food and the wine for their drink and gave them vegetables.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and understanding in all literature and science; and Daniel was skilled in all visions and dreams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And at the end of the years which the king had appointed for introducing them, the high chamberlain brought them in before Nabuchodonosar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the king conversed with them. And among them all there were none found equal to Daniel and Ananias and Misael and Azarias. So they stood before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And in every subject of wisdom and science on which the king questioned them he found them ten times more skilled than all the soothsayers and the magians who were in the realm.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Nabuchodonosar, in the second year of his reign, dreamed a dream and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king gave orders to call the soothsayers and the magians and the chymists and the Chaldees that they might tell the king his dream.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when they were come and stood before the king, the king said to them, I have dreamed and my mind is anxious to know the dream.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The king answered the Chaldees, The subject is gone from me. If you do not tell me the dream and the interpretation you shall be put to death and your houses shall be exposed to plunder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if you let me know the dream and the interpretation, you shall receive of me gifts and immunities and great honour. At all events, tell me the dream and the meaning of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will explain the meaning.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The Chaldees answered in the presence of the king and said, There is not a man on the earth who can make known what the king requireth; nor doth any king or ruler, however great, ask such a thing, of any soothsayer, magian or Chaldee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the thing which the king requireth is so difficult, that there is none who can lay it before the king, but the gods only, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Upon this the king in furious wrath gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So the decree went forth. And when the wise men began to be slain Now search had been made for Daniel and his friends to slay them</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and Daniel had then addressed Arioch, the king's marshal, who was going out to slay the wise men of Babylon,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>and Daniel had gone to his house and acquainted his friends Ananias, Misael and Azarias with the affair;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night; whereupon he blessed the God of heaven, and said,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>There is none but God in heaven who revealeth secrets.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Thy thoughts, king, on thy bed ascended to what might come to pass hereafter. And he who revealeth secrets made known to thee the things which must come to pass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And to me this secret was revealed, not indeed for any wisdom in me above all the living: but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, that thou mayst know the thoughts of thy heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Thou, king! didst behold, and lo! an image! Great was that image and its aspect lofty as it stood before thee; and its appearance was awful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>It was an image, the head of which was of pure gold; the hands and the breast and the arms of it were of silver; the belly and the thighs of brass;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>This is the dream. The meaning of it we will now explain to the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-70-2-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then king Nabuchodonosar fell on his face, and made obeisance to Daniel and ordered holy gifts, and sweet odours to be offered to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-213-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The first was like a lioness, and had wings like those of an eagle.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-298-10-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel, surnamed Baltasar. And the word is true and great power and knowledge was given him by the vision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-299-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>In those days, I Daniel, had been mourning three weeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-300-10-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I had not eaten palatable bread, nor had flesh or wine entered my mouth, neither had I anointed myself to the full end of three weeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-301-10-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>On the twenty fourth of the first month when I was on the bank of the great river, namely, Tigris Eddekel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-302-10-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I raised mine eyes and looked, and lo! a man clothed with a flowing robe and his loins girded with gold of Ophaz,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-304-10-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now, I Daniel alone saw this vision. The men who were with me did not see it; but great consternation fell upon them and they fled for fear;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-305-10-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>so I was left alone. And when I beheld this great vision, there was no strength left in me. Even my comeliness was changed into corruption and I retained no strength;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-306-10-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>but I heard the sound of his words. And when I heard him, I was struck with awe, and my face was on the ground.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-317-10-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then he said, that thou knewest that for which I came to thee, then would I return to fight for the chief of the Persians, for as I was coming, the chief of the Grecians came.</span></div>
