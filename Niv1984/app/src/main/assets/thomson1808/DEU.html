<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>After he had smitten Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon; and Og, king of Basan, who dwelt at Astaroth and Edrain,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Moses began, on the bank of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, to explain the law fully, saying.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Turn; strike your tents, and march to the mountain of the Amorites, and to all the inhabitants around Araba; to the mountain and to the plain, and to the south, and to the land of the Chananites, on the sea shore, and to Antilibanus, till you reach the river; the great river Euphrates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Behold I have delivered up the land before you.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able alone to bear you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Appoint for yourselves men of wisdom, knowledge and understanding, for your several tribes, and I will make them leaders over you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And you answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast proposed to do is good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So I took from among you men of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, and appointed them to be leaders over you; captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens; and promulgators of the law for your judges.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I gave a charge to your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger who is with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when I had given you in charge, at that time, all the things which you were to do,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>we removed from Choreb, and marched through all that great and frightful wilderness which you saw, on the way to the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God commanded us.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God giveth you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Behold the Lord your God hath delivered up to you the land before you. Go up and take possession of it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, commanded you. Fear not, nor be faint hearted.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the proposal was agreeable to me. So I took from among you twelve men; a man for every tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they turned, and went up to the mountain, and came to the valley of the bunch of grapes. And when they had thoroughly viewed it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good, which the Lord our God giveth us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Notwithstanding this, you would not go up; but disobeyed the command of the Lord our God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and murmured in your tents, saying, Because the Lord hateth us he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us utterly,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>wherever we go. When your brethren disheartened you, saying, It is a nation great and numerous, and stronger than we; and the cities are large, and walled up to the sky. Indeed we have seen there sons of giants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>I said to you, Be not terrified, nor afraid of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The Lord your God is marching before you. He will assist you in subduing them, according to all that he hath done for you in the land of Egypt,</span></div>

The Lord thy God will take charge of thee, as a man would of a son; as he hath done all the way you marched, till you came to this place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Notwithstanding this speech you did not confide in the Lord our God</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And the Lord heard the sound of your words, and being provoked to wrath, he sware saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Not one of these men shall see that good land which I, with an oath, promised their fathers,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>With me also the Lord was angry on your account, and said, Neither shalt thou go in there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And with respect to your children, who do not know good or evil, they shall go thither, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>But as for you, turn, and march into the wilderness, by the way to the Red sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then you answered, and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Whereupon the Lord said to me, Say to them, You shall not go up, nor fight; for I am not with you. And you should not be trodden down before your enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Accordingly I spoke to you; but you hearkened not to me; but transgressed the command of the Lord, and presumptuously ascended the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And the Amorites, who dwelt on the mountain, came out to meet you, and pursued you, as bees would do, and slaughtered you from Seir to Herma.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Then you sat down, and wept before the Lord our God; but the Lord hearkened not to your voice, nor paid attention to you.</span></div>
