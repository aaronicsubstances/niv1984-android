<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>when Artaxerxes was settled on his throne in the city Susoi,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>in the third year of his reign, he made an entertainment for his friends, both for other nations, and for the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and for the governors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And having after this displayed to them the riches of his kingdom, and the transporting glory of his riches, for a hundred and eighty days,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>when the days of his marriage were fulfilled, the king made an entertainment for all the nations who were in the city, for six days, in the court of the royal palace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>which was adorned with painted hangings of cotton, extended with cords of cotton, and purple yarn, to capitals of gold and silver, on pillars of parian marble and alabaster. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of smaragdine, pinine, and parian stone; and their covers were of gause, painted with a variety of flowers; and roses were scattered all around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The goblets of gold and silver, with a small carbuncled cup to each, amounted in value to thirty thousand talents. There was wine in abundance and of a sweet quality, such as the king himself drank.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now this entertainment was not according to an established custom; but the king would have it so, and he commanded the stewards to comply with his pleasure, and that of the guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Astin the queen also made an entertainment for the women in the royal palace, where king Artaxerxes was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And on the seventh day, the king, in high good humour, ordered Aman and Basan and Tharra and Barazi and Zatholtha and Abataza and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, who waited on king Artaxerxes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>to bring the queen to him to proclaim her queen, and crown her with a diadem, and shew her to the chiefs, and her beauty to the nations; for she was beautiful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But queen Astin hearkened not to him to come with the chamberlain, at which the king was greatly offended and inflamed with anger</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and he said to his friends, Astin hath spoken so and so; do you therefore execute law and judgment, touching this matter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Thereupon there came before him, Arkesaius and Sarsathaius and Malisear the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, and had the first seats next him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and told him according to the laws what ought to be done to queen Astin, because she had not done what the king had commanded by the chamberlains.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Muchaius said to the king and to the chiefs, Queen Astin hath wronged, not the king only, but also all the king's chiefs and leaders;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>for he hath told them the queen's conduct and how she hath contradicted the king. Therefore as she hath contradicted the king Artaxerxes, so will the rest of the ladies now,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>the wives of the Persian and Medean princes, upon hearing what she hath said to the king, presume in like manner to dishonour their husbands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If therefore it seemeth good to the king, let him pass a royal decree and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter it nor suffer the queen any more to approach him; but let the king give her royalty to another woman, better than her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And let this edict of the king be proclaimed, which if he cause to be done throughout his kingdom, then will all the women both rich and poor, pay respect to their husbands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the speech pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Muchaius had spoken,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>and sent the decree throughout the whole kingdom, into every province in the language and writing thereof, that men might be feared by their own families.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After this when the king's wrath was appeased and he no more remembered Astin, nor made any mention of what she had spoken, and how he had condemned her;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>the king's servants said, Let there be sought for the king a virgin of unblemished chastity, and beautiful;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them select and send to the city Susoi to the house of the women, virgins remarkable for beauty; and let them be delivered to the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women; and let the things necessary for purification be given them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And let the woman who shall please the king be made queen in the room of Astin. And the proposal pleased the king, and he did so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now there was at the city of Susoi, a man, a Jew, whose name was Mordecai. He was the son of Jairus, the son of Semeias, the son of Kisaius, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He had been carried away captive from Jerusalem among them whom Nabuchodonosar king of Babylon had captivated.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And this man had a foster child, a daughter of Aminadab, his father's brother; and her name was Esther. On the decease of her parents he educated her to be a wife for himself. But as the girl was beautiful,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>when the decree of the king was published, and many young women were brought to the city Susoi and put under the care of Gai, Esther also was brought to Gai the keeper of the women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the young woman pleased him and found favour in his sight, so that he hastened to give her the things for purification and the allotted portion; and seven waiting maids were assigned to her out of the king's house: and he treated her and her maids courteously in the house of the women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now Esther did not disclose her family, nor her country;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>for Mordecai had charged her not to tell. But Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to see what would happen to Esther.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now the time for every young woman to go to the king was when she had compleated twelve months; for thus were the days of their purification fulfilled. Six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and six months with aromatics and lotions used by women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then she goeth in to the king. The keeper is to deliver her to whomsoever the king ordereth to go with her from the women's apartment to the king's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In the evening she goeth in, and in the morning goeth with all speed to the second house of the women, which is under the care of Gai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, and no more cometh to the king unless called for by name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So when the time was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab, Mordecai's uncle, to go to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain the keeper of the women ordered her; for Esther found favour with all who saw her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Esther went in to Artaxerxes the king, in the twelfth month which is the month Adar in the seventh year of his reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the king was enamoured of Esther, and she found favour above all the virgins, so that he set the queen's crown on her head</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and made an entertainment for all his friends and potentates for seven days, and to celebrate the marriage of Esther he made a release to those under his government.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now Mordecai performed service in the court,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and Esther had not yet declared her family, for Mordecai having charged her in this manner to fear God and execute his commands as when she was with him, Esther did not alter her conduct.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And two of the king's chamberlains, who were captains of his life guard, being displeased because Mordecai was promoted, sought to kill king Artaxerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the matter being made known to Mordecai, he informed Esther and she disclosed the conspiracy to the king;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>whereupon the king having examined the chamberlains, caused them to be hanged, and ordered a record to be made in the royal library with an encomium on Mordecai's fidelity.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these things king Artaxerxes honoured Haman of Amadathus the Bougaian, and promoted him, and seated him first of all his friends,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>so that all the court bowed down to him for so the king had commanded to be done. But Mordecai did not bow down to him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>whereupon they who were in the king's court said to him, Mordecai, Why trangressest thou the king's commands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when they spoke to him daily and he hearkened not to them, they told Haman, that Mordecai disobeyed the king's commands. Now Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So when Haman understood that Mordecai did not bow down to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>he was greatly inflamed with wrath, and determined to destroy all the Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Artaxerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And having drawn up a decree in the twelfth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, he cast lots for one day after another and for one month after another so as to destroy the whole race of Mordecai in one day. And the lot having fallen on the fourteenth day of the month Adar,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>he spoke to king Artaxerxes, saying, There is a nation scattered among the nations throughout thy whole kingdom, whose laws differ from all the nations.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-59-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>if it seemeth good to the king, let him pass a decree to destroy them and I will subscribe ten thousand talents of silver to the king's treasury.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Thereupon the king taking off his ring gave it to Haman to seal the writings against the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-61-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the king said to Haman, Keep the money, and do with the nation what thou pleasest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-62-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So the king's secretaries were convened on the thirteenth day of the first month, and they wrote as Haman directed to the generals and the governors in every province, from India to Ethiopia a hundred and twenty seven provinces, and to the chiefs of the nations according to their dialect in the name of king Artaxerxes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-63-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and the decree was despatched by posts throughout the whole kingdom of Artaxerxes, to destroy the race of the Jews on a certain day of the twelfth month which is Adar, and to make spoil of their goods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-64-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And copies of the decree were to be sent through every province and all the nations were ordered to be ready against that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-65-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the business was despatched at Susoi, the king and Haman sat down to revel, but the city was struck with consternation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-68-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when Mordecai knew what was done, he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed himself with ashes, and running through the street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, A nation is to be cut off, which hath committed no fault.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-69-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But when he came to the king's gate, he stopped; for it was not lawful for him to enter the court in sackcloth and ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-70-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And in every country where the writings were published there was a cry with lamentation and great grief among the Jews, and they put on sackcloth and ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-71-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When the queen's maids and chamberlains came in and told her, she was troubled at the news, and sent to clothe Mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him; but he would not be persuaded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-72-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Esther called Achrathaius her chamberlain, who attended her, and sent him to learn from Mordecai an exact state of the matter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-74-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Whereupon Mordecai told him what was done and the promise which Haman had made to the king of ten thousand talents to the royal treasury, that he might destroy the Jews;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-75-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and he gave him a copy of the decree for their destruction, which was published among the Susians to shew it to Esther, and told him that he charged her to go in and supplicate the king and to entreat him for the people, calling to mind the days of thy humiliation when thou wast brought up by my bounty. Seeing Haman who is second to the king, hath spoken against us to destroy us, call thou upon the Lord and speak to the king for us, to deliver us from death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-76-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Accordingly Achrathaius went in and told her all these words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-77-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Thereupon Esther said to him, Go to Mordecai and tell him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-79-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When Achrathaius delivered this message of Esther to Mordecai,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-80-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Mordecai said to him, Go say to her, Esther, do not flatter thyself that thou alone of all the Jews in the kingdom shall escape.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-81-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Be assured, that if thou neglectest the present opportunity, help and protection will come to the Jews from some other quarter; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-82-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Esther sent back the messenger to Mordecai, saying,</span></div>
