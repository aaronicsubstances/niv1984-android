<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>These are the names of Israel's sons who went down to Egypt with their father Jacob. They went every one with his whole family;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now Joseph was in Egypt. And all the souls from Jacob were seventy five.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when Joseph was dead and all his brothers and all that generation</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and the children of Israel had increased and multiplied and were become numerous and grew more and more powerful and the land caused them to abound,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to his nation, Behold the race of the children of Israel is become a great multitude, and is mightier than we.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Come therefore, let us deal subtilly with them. Perhaps when they are multiplied, if a war should happen to us, they will join our enemies and fight against us and depart out of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So he set task masters over them to afflict them with labours and they built for Pharao fortified cities, namely, Peitho and Ramesses and On, which is Heliopolis.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew stronger and stronger. So the Egyptians were abhorred by the children of Israel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and the Egyptians ruled over the Israelites with rigour</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and made their lives bitter with hard labour in working clay and making bricks and with all the toils of the field, according to the several kinds of service to which they forcibly subjected them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Moreover the king of the Egyptians spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the first in rank was Sepphora and the name of the second Phua,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and said, When you do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women and they are delivered, if it be a male child, kill it; but if it be a female preserve it alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the males.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Whereupon the king of Egypt sent for the midwives and said to them, why have you done this and saved the male children?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the midwives said to Pharao, The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian; for they bring forth instantly. Before the midwives can come to them, they are delivered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew mighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And because the midwives feared God they established families for themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Pharao gave orders to all his people saying, Every male child which is born to the Hebrews you shall throw into the river, but preserve every female alive.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now there was a certain man of the tribe of Levi who had married one of the daughters of Levi</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and she conceived and bore a son. And when they saw that he was a beautiful child they hid him three months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But when they could not conceal him any longer, his mother provided for him a wicker basket and plaistered it with bitumenous pitch and put the child into it and placed it in the stagnant water by the side of the river.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his sister watched it at a distance to see what would become of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the daughter of Pharao came to bathe herself at the river and her maids were walking with her along the bank. And seeing the basket in the stagnant water she sent her maid and had it brought to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And upon opening it she saw in the basket a child weeping. And the daughter of Pharao had compassion on it and said, This is one of the Hebrew children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Whereupon his sister said to Pharao's daughter, Shall I call for thee a nurse from among the Hebrews to suckle the child for thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the daughter of Pharao said, Go. Upon which the girl went and called the child's mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the daughter of Pharao said to her, Take care of this child for me and suckle it for me; and I will pay thee the wages. So the woman took the child and suckled it;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and when the boy was grown up she brought him to Pharao's daughter and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, saying, I drew him out of the water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And after a course of many years, when Moses was become great he went out to his brethren the children of Israel. And as he was observing their distress, he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, who was one of his brethren the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Whereupon looking about on every side and seeing no body he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And going out the next day he saw two Hebrew men quarrelling and said to him who was in the wrong, Why dost thou beat thy neighbour?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>To which he replied, Who made thee a ruler or a judge over us? Dost thou mean to kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday? Thereupon Moses was alarmed and said, Is the thing become so public?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now when Pharao heard of this deed he sought to slay Moses, but he withdrew from the presence of Pharao and took up his abode in the land of Madiam. When he came to the land of Madiam he sat down by a well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the priest of Madiam had seven daughters who tended the flocks of their father Jothor. And they having come to the well began to draw water to fill the troughs that they might water the flocks of their father Jothor,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>and the shepherds came and drove them away. Upon which Moses arose and protected them and drew water for them and watered their flocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when they came to their father Raguel, he said to them, Why have you come so soon to-day?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>To which they replied, An Egyptian protected us from the shepherds and drew for us and watered our flocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why did you leave the man behind? Therefore call him that he may eat bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So Moses dwelt with the man; and he gave him his daughter Sepphora to be his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And his wife conceived and bore him a son; And Moses called his name Gersam, saying, Because I am a sojourner in a strange land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And after those many years the king of Egypt died and the Israelites groaned under their labours and raised a loud outcry; and their cry on account of their labours ascended up to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And God heard their groans. And God remembered his covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaak and Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And God looked upon the Israelites and was made known to them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a fire blazing out of a bush. And when he saw that the bush blazed with fire, but was not consumed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Moses said, I will go near and see this great sight; why the bush is not consumed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But when the Lord saw that he drew near to look; the Lord called to him out of the bush saying, Moses! Moses! And he said, What is it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he said, Approach not hither. Loose the sandals from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-59-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Moses, I have indeed seen the affliction of my people in Egypt and have heard their cry on the account of their task masters; for I know their sorrow,</span></div>
