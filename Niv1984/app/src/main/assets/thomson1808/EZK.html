<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And each had four faces, and each had four wings; and their legs were straight</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and their feet winged and sparking like sparkling brass. And their wings had a quick motion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And underneath their wings on their four sides was a man's hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the faces of the four turned not when they went. They marched forward each having a face on every side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And with regard to the similitude of their faces, the four had the face of a man with the face of a lion, on the right; and on the left the four had the face of a bullock, and the four had a face of an eagle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the wings of the four were expanded upwards, each having a pair expanded adjoining each other and a pair folded on their body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they moved on, each straight forward, which way soever the wind was moving, they moved on, and turned not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And in the midst of the four living beings, was an appearance like that of glowing coals of fire, resembling lamps whirling round between the</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I beheld and lo! on the ground, close to the four living beings a wheel! one to every of the four.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the appearance of the wheels was like the appearance of a beryl. And the four had one and the same likeness. And their workmanship was as if there was a wheel within a wheel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They ran on their four sections and shifted not their position when they ran,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And when the living beings moved on, the wheels moved on close by them. And when the living beings mounted up from the earth, the wheels mounted up.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>when those stood still, these stood still: and when those mounted up from the earth, these mounted up with them, because there was a breath of life in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And over the head of the living beings, there was a likeness resembling a firmament, like the appearance of chrystal over their wings, which were expanded above them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And their wings which were expanded below the firmament, flapped one against another, while every one had a pair that covered their bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when they moved on I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of much water: but when they stopped, their wings were still.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And lo! a voice from above the firmament!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>this being over their heads, there was an appearance like that of a sapphire stone and a resemblance of a throne upon it. And upon the resemblance of the throne a resemblance like the appearance of a man above.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And I saw a resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards; and from the appearance of the loins and downwards, I saw an appearance of fire: and the splendor thereof round about</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>was like the bow which is in the clouds in a showery day. Such was the state of the splendor round about.</span></div>
