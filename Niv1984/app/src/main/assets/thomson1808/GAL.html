<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from the dead;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and all the brethren with me, to the congregations of Galatia;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>favour be to you and peace from God the father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>to whom be the glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I am astonished that you are so soon carried away, to another message of peace, from him who by the favour of Christ called you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>which is owing to nothing but this, that there are some who trouble you, and wish to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But if we, or an angel from heaven, proclaim to you as glad tidings any thing different from what we have proclaimed to you, let him be an anathema. As we said before,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>so I now say again, If any one teach you as glad tidings any thing different from what you have received, let him be anathema.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For do I now conciliate the favour of men rather than of God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now I certify to you, brethren, that the message of glad tidings which I proclaimed is not according to man;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>for I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it; but by revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For you have heard of my behaviour formerly in the Jewish religion; that I, in the most violent manner, persecuted the congregation of God, and ravaged it;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and that I made a greater proficiency in Judaism than many fellow students of my age, in my own nation, being more abundantly a zealot for the doctrines of my fathers:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>but when it pleased God, who had set me apart from my birth, and by his special favour called me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>to reveal his son to me, that I might proclaim the good tidings of him among the nations immediately; I did not consult flesh and blood,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me, but went away to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But I did not see any other of the apostles, save James the brother of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now as to what I write to you, behold, God is witness that I do not lie.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then I went to the regions of Syria, and Cilicia,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>and was personally unknown to the Christian congregations of Judea,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>who had only heard that he who formerly persecuted us is now proclaiming the glad tidings of that belief which he was formerly destroying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and they glorified God on my account.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>About fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I went up indeed according to a revelation, and stated to them the glad tidings which I proclaim among the nations; privately indeed to those in high repute, that the race, which I run, or had run, might in no wise be frustrate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But neither Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>nor did I, (on account of the false brethren who had slily introduced themselves, and crept in, to spy out that liberty of ours which we have by Christ Jesus, that they might enslave us)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>yield for a moment any submission to them, that the truth of the glad tidings might continue with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And with regard to those in high repute (what they were formerly doth not concern me: God accepteth not man's person; for these men of repute added nothing to me;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but, on the contrary, seeing that I was intrusted with the message of glad tidings for the uncircumcision, as Peter was with that for the circumcision;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>for he, who had communicated power to Peter for the mission to the circumcision, communicated power also to me for the nations)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>even James, and Cephas, and John, those eminent pillars, knowing the favour granted to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should be for the nations, and they for the circumcision,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>recommending only that we would remember the poor, which very thing I had indeed been forward to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when Peter came to Antioch I opposed him to his face, because he was reprehensible.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For before certain persons came from James, he had eaten with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew, and kept himself apart, being afraid of them who were of the circumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him, insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before them all, If thou being a Jew mayst live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, why compellest thou the Gentiles to conform to the rites of the Jews?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>We who are by nature Jews, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>knowing that a man is not justified by works of law unless by means of a belief in Jesus Christ, even, we ourselves have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified for a belief in Christ and not for works of law; because for works of law no flesh can be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if we, seeking to be justified by Christ, have ourselves also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Let not this be supposed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now if I build up again that which I pulled down I make myself a transgressor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>As for me, I by law died to law, that I may live to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; not I myself any more, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in flesh, I live by that belief which I have in the son of God, who loved me and delivered up himself for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>do not set at naught the favour of God; for if righteousness be by means of law, Christ hath indeed died to no purpose.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness, 7 know therefore, that they who are believers are children of Abraham.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The scripture indeed, foreseeing that God would justify the nations for belief, predicted to Abraham the glad tidings in these words, By thee all the nations shall be blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-59-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So that they who are believers are blessed with the believing Abraham.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-63-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>From this curse of the law Christ hath redeemed us, being made a curse for us; (for it is written, Cursed, is every one who is suspended on a cross,)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-66-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and the promises were made to Abraham and the seed of him (it is not said and to the seeds as if it was a covenant for many, but as if for one, and to the seed of thee; namely Christ)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-67-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>now this I say that the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul a covenant ratified by God for Christ, so as to put a stop to the promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-68-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise; but God granted it freely by promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-69-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>To what purpose then was the law? On the account of transgressions it was superadded until the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; and it was introduced through angels by the hand of a mediator;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-70-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>but this mediator was not of one party. But God is one party;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-71-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>is then the law against the promises of God? No by no means; for if a law had been given which could have put into a state of life, righteousness would assuredly have been by law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-72-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the scripture hath shut all up under sin, that the promise for belief in Jesus Christ might be granted to them who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-73-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now before this belief came, we were under the custody of law, shut up together for the future belief to be revealed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-115-5-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>therefore stand up for the liberty with which Christ hath made us free, and be not again entangled with a yoke of bondage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-116-5-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Behold I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-117-5-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And I testify again to every man who is circumcised, that he is under an obligation to perform the whole law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-118-5-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>You who are justified by law, have done with the Christ; you have fallen from that favour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-119-5-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As for us then, we by the spirit entertain a hope of justification for faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-120-5-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing, but a belief made operative by love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-121-5-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You were running well. Who hath stopped you from obeying the truth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-122-5-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>This persuasion cometh not from him who called you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-123-5-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>A little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-124-5-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I have a confidence in the Lord with respect to you, that you will keep your minds bent on nothing else, and that he who troubleth you, whoever he may be, will bear the blame</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-125-5-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As for me, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offence of the cross is done away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-126-5-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I wish that they who are unsettling you would cut themselves off:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-127-5-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>for you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only let not that liberty be an advantage to the flesh; but be servants to one another by offices of love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-128-5-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For the whole law is summed up in this one precept, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-129-5-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not destroyed by one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-130-5-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>This then I say, walk by the spirit and by no means fulfil the lust of the flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-131-5-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the inclinations of the flesh are contrary to the spirit; and the inclinations of the spirit are contrary to the flesh; they are opposed to one another; so that you do not, what you wish;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-132-5-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>but if you are led by the spirit you are not under law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-133-5-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now the works of the flesh are manifest; they are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-134-5-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>idolatry, fascinations, enmities, strifes, emulations, animosities, contentions, factions, sects,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-135-5-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and the like, of which I forewarn you, as I have indeed before declared that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-136-5-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-137-5-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>meekness, temperance; against such things there is no law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-138-5-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now they who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-139-5-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>If we live by spirit let us walk by spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-140-5-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Let us not be vain glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-143-6-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, do you, who are spiritual, set such a one right again, with a spirit of meekness, keeping an eye on thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-144-6-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-145-6-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For if any one thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-146-6-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now let every one prove his own work, and then he. will have his boasting for himself alone and not for another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-147-6-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For every one shall bear his own burden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-148-6-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let him who is taught the word make him who teacheth a partaker in all good things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-149-6-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Be not deceived. God is not to be imposed on; for whatever a man soweth, that he shall reap.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-150-6-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Because he who soweth for his flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption; but he who soweth for the spirit shall from the spirit reap life everlasting;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-151-6-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>therefore let us not be weary in well doing, for in due time we shall reap without being tired.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-152-6-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>As we therefore have an opportunity let us do good to all, but more especially to them who are of the household of faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-153-6-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>You see in what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-154-6-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>As many as are desirous of making a figure in flesh, these are constraining you to be circumcised, only that they may avoid being persecuted for the cross of the Christ</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-155-6-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For even they themselves, being circumcised, do not keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-156-6-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But far be it from me to boast, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified to me and I to the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-157-6-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing; but a new creation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-158-6-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And with regard to all who will walk by this rule, on them there will be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-159-6-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the future let no one trouble me, for on this body of mine I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
