<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The vision which Ambakum the prophet saw.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>How long, O Lord shall I cry, and thou not hearken? How long shall I being injured cry to thee, and thou not save?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Why hast thou pointed out to me to behold labours and sorrows, misery and impiety? A suit is instituted against me and the judge receiveth bribes</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>therefore law is disregarded and the cause is not brought to an issue. Because a wicked man oppresseth the just, therefore wrong judgment will be given.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>See ye despisers! and view intently and be amazed at wonderful things and vanish. For in your days I am doing a work which you will not believe though one tell you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For lo! I am raising up the Chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation, which marcheth over the breadth of the earth, to possess dwellings which belong not to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He is terrible and illustrious; his judgment will be from himself, and from himself his prophesy will proceed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>His horses can out leap leopards and are swifter than the lynxes of Arabia. When his horsemen have mounted, they will rush impetuously from afar, and will fly like an eagle, eager for prey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Destruction will come on the wicked who set themselves against him; and he will gather captives like the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He indeed will riot in kings; and petty princes will be his scorn. Of every fortress he will make a scoff and will raise a mount and take it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then he will change his mind and depart and be pacified. This is the majesty which belongeth to my God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Art not thou from everlasting? Lord, my God, my Holy One! let us not die. Thou, Lord, hast appointed this for judgment: and formed it that its correction may work conviction in me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Thine eye is too pure to behold wicked deeds, or to look on the labours of sorrow. Why lookest thou upon despisers? Wilt thou be silent when the wicked swallow up the righteous?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Wilt thou make these men like the fishes of the sea, and like those reptiles which have no leader?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He hath drawn up destruction with a hook, and hath dragged out one with a dredge, and enclosed another with his sweep net. For this cause he will rejoice and his heart will be glad;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>therefore he will sacrifice to his net and burn incense to his dredge. Because by these he made his mess rich and his food delicious,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>shall he on the account of this cast his dredge, and not spare to slay nations continually?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord answered and said, Write a vision: write it distinctly in a book that the reader may trace these things;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>for the vision is for a time yet to come. But it will spring up at last and will not be vain. Though he may tarry, wait for him; for he will assuredly come and will not fail.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>If any one draw back my soul hath no pleasure in him. But the just shall live by faith in me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now this arrogant and contemptuous man; this man of boasts shall not exceed a certain bound.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>will they not all take up a parable against him and a fable to tell of him, saying, Woe to him who is heaping up for himself things which do not belong to him? For how long? And making his yoke grievously heavy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For biters of him shall start up suddenly. And the plotters against thee shall be sober and thou shalt be plunder for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remaining peoples shall plunder thee for the blood of mankind, and for the impieties of a land and a city and of all them who inhabit it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Woe to him who coveteth wicked gain for his house, that he</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>may raise his nest high to be out of the reach of evils. Thou hast contrived shame for thy house; thou hast provoked many</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>peoples and thy soul hath sinned; for a stone out of a wall will cry out, and a Worm from a beam will proclaim these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Woe to him who buildeth a city with blood and furbisheth up a city with iniquities!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Are not these things from the Lord Almighty? When many nations have fainted by fire, and many peoples have been dispirited,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Woe to him who maketh his neighbour drink a foamy intoxicating draught, making him drunk that he may inspect his caves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Because of thy glory drink thou also a full draught of dishonour, and be confounded at heart and shaken.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the impiety at Libanus shall cover thee and the sufferings of wild beasts shall terrify thee, on the account of the blood of mankind, and for the wickedness of a land and a city and of all them who inhabit it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Of what avail is a graven thing, that they have engraved it? Did one cause a molten mass, a false fantasy, to be cast, because the caster had a confidence that by casting he would make dumb idols?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Woe to him who saith to wood, Awake; arise. And to stone, be thou exalted. The one is indeed a fantasy; and the other, a plating of gold and silver: there is no breath in it.</span></div>
