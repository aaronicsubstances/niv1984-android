<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>GOD, who in sundry parcels and in divers manners spake in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>hath in these last days spoken to us by a son whom he hath constituted heir of all things, by whom also he made the ages;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>who being an effulgence of the glory, and an impress of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having by himself made a purification of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>being made as much superior to the heavenly messengers as the name he hath inherited is more excellent than theirs:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>for to which of those messengers did he ever say, Thou art my son, this day I have begotten thee. And again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And again when he would bring the first born into the world, he saith, And let all God's messengers worship him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now in respect to the messengers it is said, Who maketh winds his messengers, and flaming fire his ministers:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but with respect to the son, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: The sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of rectitude:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Thou didst love righteousness and hate iniquity, Therefore God, thy God anointed thee With the oil of joy above thy associates?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this cause we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest we, through negligence, let them slip.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if the word spoken by messengers was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received as its reward a correspondent requital,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation, which was first published by the Lord, and confirmed for us by them who heard him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>God giving a joint testimony, by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of a holy spirit, according to his own will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For he did not subject to angels the dispensation to come, of which we are speaking;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>but one in a certain place hath testified, saying, What is man, that thou shouldst be mindful of him! Or a son of man, that thou shouldst visit him!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Thou madest him a little lower than angels; With glory and honour thou hast crowned him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And set him over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we see him who was made a little lower than angels namely Jesus, on account of suffering death crowned with glory and honour, that so he by the favour of God might taste death for every man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, when bringing many sons to glory to make the leader of their salvation perfect by sufferings.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>As the children therefore were partakers of flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same in order that he might, by his death, put a stop to the operation of him who hath the power of death, that is the devil;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and deliver from bondage them who were all their lives liable to the fear of death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For he indeed doth not take hold of angels, but taketh hold of the seed of Abraham,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>whence it behoved him to be made like his brethren in all things; that he might be a merciful and faithful chief priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So in mine indignation I solemnly said, They shall not enter into my rest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For some hearers provoked him; but did they not all come out of Egypt by Moses?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now, against whom was he incensed forty years? Was it not against them who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For we have had the glad tidings proclaimed to us, as they also had; but the word which they heard did not profit them; as it was not mixed up with belief by the hearers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-118-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now consider what a great personage he was to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-119-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The Levites indeed who receive the priesthood have according to law a commandment to tithe the people, that is their own brethren descended from the loins of Abraham;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-126-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For the priesthood being changed there is of necessity a change of the law.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-183-9-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For the Christ did not enter into holies made with hands, the symbols of the true; but into heaven itself; now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf:</span></div>
