<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-216-14-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Israel, return to the Lord thy God. Seeing they have been weakened for thine iniquities,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-217-14-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>take words with you and return to the Lord your God, and, that you may not receive the punishment of iniquity but may receive good things, say to him, We will render to thee the fruit of our lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-218-14-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Assur cannot save us. We will no more mount horses; we will no more say to the works of our hand, You are our gods. He who is in thee will compassionate the fatherless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-219-14-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I will heal their habitations. I will undoubtedly love them. Because he hath turned away my wrath from him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-220-14-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I will be to Israel like dew. He shall bloom like a lily, and shoot out his roots like Lebanon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-221-14-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>His branches shall spread; and he shall be like a fruitful olive tree, and like that of Lebanon shall be his fragrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-222-14-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They shall return and dwell under his shade; they shall live and be plentifully fed with corn. And he shall flourish like a vine and the memorial of him shall be like the wine of Lebanon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-223-14-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>As for Ephraim, what hath he any more to do with idols? I humbled him and I will strengthen him. I am like a fruitful juniper; from me thou shalt find fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-224-14-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Who is wise that he may understand these things, prudent, that he may know them? Because the ways of the Lord are straight; therefore the righteous will walk in them: But in them the wicked shall be without strength.</span></div>
