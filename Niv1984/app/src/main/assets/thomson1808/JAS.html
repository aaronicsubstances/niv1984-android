<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But let him ask with faith, without wavering, for he who wavereth is like a wave of the sea, raised by the wind and tossed about.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Happy the man, who endureth a trial! because having stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them who love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Let no one when tempted say, I am tempted of God. For God cannot be tempted by evil, neither doth he tempt any one.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man viewing his natural face in a glass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For having viewed himself, and gone away, he instantly forgot what manner of person he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But whosoever hath looked carefully into the perfect law of this liberty, and continued therein; he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work, shall by his doing be happy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>If any one among you thinketh to be religious without bridling his tongue, he is but deceiving his heart. Such a one's religion is vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and father is this, to take the oversight and care of orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep one's self unspotted from the world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if there should come into your assembly a man in splendid dress, having his fingers adorned with gold rings; and there should come in also a poor man in mean apparel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and you should pay respect to the man in the splendid dress, and say to him, sit thou here in an honourable place; and say to the poor man, stand thou there; or, sit here below my footstool:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>have you not actually made distinctions among yourselves, and become ill principled judges?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But you have treated the poor with disdain. Do not the rich domineer over you? Do they not drag you to tribunals?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>but if you have respect of persons, you commit sin, and are by that law convicted as transgressors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For whosoever is to keep the whole law and shall fail in one point, is guilty of all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For it having said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, hath also said, Thou shalt not murder. Now, if thou shall not commit adultery, but shalt commit murder, thou art become a transgressor of law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Thus speak and act thus, as you are to be judged by a law of liberty;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>for the sentence of judgment shall be without mercy for him who hath not exercised mercy, though mercy glorieth over a sentence of judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>What is the advantage, my brethren, though one should say he hath belief, when he hath not works? Can that belief save him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Suppose a brother or a sister be naked, or in want of daily food,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and one of you should say to them, go in peace: be warmed, and be fed to the full; and you do not give them the things necessary for the body, is this any advantage?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Just so it is in respect to this belief, if it hath not works; being by itself it is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>One indeed may say, thou hast belief, and I have works. Shew me thy belief by thy works. As for me, I will shew thee my belief by my works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well. The demons also believe and tremble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But wouldst thou, vain man, know that belief without works is dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works when he offered up his son Isaak on the altar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Thou seest that his belief co-operated with his works, and by his works his belief was perfected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by belief only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>In like manner also, was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, having secreted the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For as the body without spirit is dead, so belief without works is dead also.</span></div>
