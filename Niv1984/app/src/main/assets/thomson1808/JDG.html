<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord said, Juda shall go up. Behold I have delivered the land into his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Whereupon Juda said to his brother Symeon, Come up with me in my lot, and let us array ourselves against the Chananites, and I will go up with thee in thy lot. So Symeon went up with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Juda went up, and the Lord delivered into their hands the Chananites, and the Pherezites, and they smote them in Bezek, to the number of ten thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When they came up with Adonibezek, in Bezek, they drew up in array against him, and smote the Chananites and the Pherezites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Adonibezek fled, and they pursued him, and took him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Whereupon Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, have been under my table, gathering up the offals thereof; therefore as I have done, so hath God requited me: And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>(Now the children of Juda had fought against Jerusalem, and taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And, after that, the children of Juda had gone down to wage war with the Chananites, who inhabited the hilly country, and the south, and the plain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And when Juda went against the Chananites who dwelt in Chebron, (the name of which city formerly was Kariath-arbok-sepher,) Chebron came out against them; and they smote Sessi, and Achiman, and Tholmi, descendants of Enak,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and they went up thence against the inhabitants of Dabir, (now the name of Dabir formerly was Kariath-sepher city of letters)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and Chaleb said, whoever will smite the city of letters, and take it, I will give him my daughter Ascha for a wife;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>whereupon Gothoniel, the younger son of Kenez, Chaleb's brother, took it, and Chaleb gave him his daughter Ascha for a wife,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and when she was going home to him, Gothoniel persuaded her to ask a field of her father: so she murmured, and with a loud voice said, as she was riding, Thou hast sent me away to the land of the south. And Chaleb said to her, What is the matter with thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Ascha said to him, Give me, I beseech thee, a blessing. Since thou hast sent me away to the land of the south, thou shouldst therefore give me a portion of water.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the children of Jothor, the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up from the city of palm trees, with the children of Juda, into the wilderness, which is in the south of Juda, at the steep of Arad, and dwelt with this tribe.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Juda went with his brother Symeon, and smote the Chananites who dwelt in Sepheth, and utterly destroyed them, and called the name of that city Anathema.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>With regard to the children of Joseph, they went up to Baithel, and the Lord was with them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and they encamped near, and kept a watch upon Baithel. (Now the name of that city formerly was Louza.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they who kept watch, looked, and behold a man came out of the city; and they took him, and said to him, Shew us the way into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So he shewed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they suffered the man and his family to depart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the man went to the land of Chettin, and built there a city, and called its name Louza, and this continueth to be its name to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Manasses did not take Baithsan, which is now called Scythopolis nor its towns; nor the lands about it; nor Thanek, nor any of its towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor any of its towns; nor the inhabitants of Balak, nor any of the habitations about it, nor its towns; nor the inhabitants of Magedo, nor any of the habitations around it, nor its towns; nor the inhabitants of Jeblaam, nor any of its surrounding habitations, nor its towns; So the Chananites took the opportunity to settle in that land;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>but when Israel grew strong, they subjected the Chananites to tribute, but did not utterly root them out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>So Aser dwelt in the midst of the Chananites who inhabited that land, because he could not drive them out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>As for the children of Dan, the Amorites harassed them on the mountains, for they did not suffer them to go down into the vale.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So there went up a messenger of the Lord from Galgal to Wailing, namely to Baithel, to the house of Israel, and said to them, Thus saith the Lord, I caused you to come up out of Egypt, and brought you into this land which I solemnly promised your fathers, and I said I will never break my covenant with you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>therefore you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land, nor worship their gods; but you shall break to pieces their graven images, and demolish their altars.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>therefore I have said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be curbs for you; and their gods shall be to you a stumbling block.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now when Joshua had dismissed the people, and every man had gone to his inheritance to take possession of the land,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-200-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Gideon, The people with thee are too numerous for me to deliver Madiam into their hands. Perhaps they may boast against me saying, My own hand hath saved me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-204-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And it came to pass that the number of them who lapped, by putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</span></div>
