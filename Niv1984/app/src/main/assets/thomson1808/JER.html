<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The word of God which came to Jeremias the son of Chelkias, one of the priests who dwelt at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>as the word of God came to him in the days of Josias son of Amos king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Thereupon I said, self-existent sovereign, Lord! behold I know not how to speak, for I am a child.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Behold I have this day set thee over nations and over kingdoms to root out and demolish and destroy; and to rebuild and plant.</span></div>
