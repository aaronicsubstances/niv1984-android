<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Moreover John testified saying, I beheld the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Now for my part I did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize in water, even he said to me, On whomsoever thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth in a holy spirit.</span></div>
