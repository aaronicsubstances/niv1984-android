<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a man in the country of Ausitis whose name was Job. He was a man of truth and integrity, just, pious, and who abstained from every thing that was evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He had seven sons and three daughters; and his cattle were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred breeding asses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>His attendants were numerous, and his works great in the country. He was also a man of illustrious birth, among the people of the east.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now his sons had a custom of meeting at each others houses, and making an entertainment, each on his day, taking along with them their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And soon as the days of the entertainment were over, Job sent for, and purified them early the next morning, and offered sacrifices for them according to their numbers; a young bull for a sin offering for each of them; for Job said, Perhaps my children have in their mind conceived evil before God. In this manner therefore Job acted after every of those days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And it came to pass that on the same day, when lo! the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan also came with them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and the Lord said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan in reply said to the Lord, Having gone round the earth, and roved the whole of it under heaven, I am come here.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the Lord said to him, Hast thou harboured in thy mind any thing against my servant Job? For there is not like him on the earth, a man unblameable, true, pious, abstaining from every thing evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Satan in reply said before the Lord, Doth Job worship the Lord for nothing?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Hast thou not made a hedge about all that he hath, abroad and at home, and about all that belong to him round about, and blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle on the earth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But put forth thine hand and touch all that he hath, he will indeed openly renounce thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then the Lord said to Satan, Behold all that he hath I deliver into thine hand; but himself thou must not touch. So Satan went out from the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and after that, on the same day, when the sons and daughters of Job were drinking wine at their elder brother's house,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>lo! a messenger came to Job, and said to him, The oxen were ploughing and the asses feeding near them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and the plunderers came and carried them off. Thy servants also they slew with the sword, and I alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>While he was yet speaking, another messenger came, and said to Job; Fire hath fallen from heaven and burned up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds likewise; and I, alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>While this one was still speaking, another messenger came and said to Job, The horsemen, having formed three bands against us, surrounded the camels and have carried them off, and slain thy servants with the sword; and I, alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came, and said to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking at their eldest brother's,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>a great blast of wind came up suddenly from the wilderness, and took the four corners of the house, so that the house fell upon thy children, and they are dead, and I, alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Upon this Job rising up rent his clothes, and shaved his head, and falling on the ground he worshipped</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and said, Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall depart hence.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>In all these things which befel him, Job transgressed not against the Lord, nor imputed indiscretion to his God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan said before the Lord, Having traversed that under heaven, and roved through the whole of it, I am come here</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Satan, Thou hast therefore attended to my servant Job; that there is not of those on the earth a man like him, guiltless, true, unblameable, abstaining from all evil.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>In reply to which Satan said to the Lord, Skin for skin. All that a man hath he will give for his life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the Lord said to Satan, Behold I deliver him up to thee, only preserve his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Thereupon Satan withdrew from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with foul ulcers from head to foot,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>so that he took a shell to scrape away the ichor, and sat down in an unclean place without the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And much time having elapsed, his wife said to him, How long wilt thou persist saying, Behold I will wait yet a little longer, in hope and expectation of my deliverance? For behold the memorial of thee; those sons and daughters, whom I brought forth with pangs and sorrow, and for whom I toiled in vain, are vanished from the earth; and thou thyself sittest among the putrefaction of worms, all night long in the open air, while I am wandering about, or working for wages, from place to place and from house to house, wishing for the setting of the sun, that I may rest from the labours and sorrows I endure. Do but say something for the Lord and die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Whereupon he looking stedfastly at her said, Like one of the women without understanding hast thou spoken? If we have received good things at the hand of the Lord, shall we not bear up under afflictions? In all these things which befel him, Job transgressed not with his lips against God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now when his three friends heard of all the calamities which were come upon him, they came to him each from his own country, namely, Eliphaz the king of the Thaimanites, Baldad the sovereign of the Saucheans, and Sophar the king of the Minaians. Having made an appointment they came to him to comfort and take care of him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>but seeing him at a distance they did not know him. Then raising their voices they wept aloud, and having rent each his robe and sprinkled themselves with dust,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>they sat down by him seven days and seven nights. And none of them spoke. For they saw that the stroke was grievous and very great.</span></div>

His first name was Jobab, and having married an Arabian woman, he had by her a son whose name was Ennon. Now he himself was a son of father Zare, one of the sons of Esau, and his mother's name was Bosorra: so that he was the fifth in descent from Abraham. Now these were the kings who reigned in Edom, over which country he also bore rule. The first was Balak, the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dannaba. And after Balak, Jobab, who is called Job; and after him, Asom who was general from the region of Thaimanitis; and after him, Adad, son of Barad, who smote Madiam in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Gethaim. And the friends who came to Job were Eliphaz, of the sons of Esau, the king of the Thaimanites; Baldad, the sovereign of the Saucheans, and Sophar, the king of the Minaians.</span></div>
