<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Hear these things ye elders! And give ear all ye inhabitants of the land! Have such things happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Of these things give an account to your children; and let your children tell their children; and their children, another generation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Awake ye drunkards, from your wine and weep. Sing a mournful song all ye who drink wine to drunkenness; for joy and gladness are gone from your mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For against my land a nation is come up, strong and innumerable. Their teeth are the teeth of lions; and their grinders, those of a young lion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They have made my vineyard a desolation; and my fig orchards, a waste. They have searched it thoroughly and it is gone to wreck; they have made the branches thereof white.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Let thy song of Woe before me be more plaintive than that of a bride clothed with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>because the fields are wasted. Let the land mourn: because the corn hath suffered grievously: wine is dried away; oil is diminished;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>husbandmen are parched up: Mourn, ye farms, for the wheat and barley, because the harvester is perished from the field.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>what shall we substitute for ourselves? The herds of cattle uttered mournful lowings, because there was no pasture for them; and the flocks of sheep are utterly destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>To thee, Lord, let me cry for myself, because a fire hath consumed the pleasant places of the wilderness, and a flame hath blasted all the trees of the field.</span></div>
