<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the death of Moses, the Lord spoke to Joshua, son of Nave, the lieutenant of Moses, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My servant Moses is dead, now therefore arise, and cross the Jordan, thou and all the people, into the land which I give them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Every place, on which you tread with the sole of your feet, I will give you, as I said to Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The wilderness, and yonder Antilibanus, to the river, the great river Euphrates, and to the farthest sea, at the setting of the sun, shall be your boundaries.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not a man shall withstand you all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt parcel out to this people the land, which I solemnly promised their fathers to give to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore be strong, and courageous, to watch, and to do as my servant Moses commanded. Thou must not deviate from them, to the right or to the left. That thou mayst clearly understand all that thou art to do:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>the book of the Law must never be out of thy mouth. Thou must study it day and night, that thou mayst know how to do all that are written. Then shalt thou be prospered; and thou wilt make thy ways prosperous; and then thou shalt have a good understanding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Behold I have commanded thee; be strong and courageous: fear not, nor be dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Upon this Joshua gave orders to the officers of the people, saying;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Go through the camp of the people, and give them orders, saying, Prepare all necessary provisions; for in three days you are to cross the Jordan, to go in and take possession of the land which the Lord the God of your fathers giveth you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Joshua said to Reuben, and Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Remember what Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you saying; The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Let your wives, and your children, and your cattle abide in the land which he hath given you; but you, all your able bodied men, well equipt, shall cross over before your brethren, and assist them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>until the Lord our God shall give your brethren rest, as well as you; and until they possess the land which the Lord our God giveth them.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Thereupon they answered and said to Joshua, All that thou commandest we will do. And wherever thou sendest us we will go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>As we have hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee. Let but the Lord our God be with thee, as he was with Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and whosoever shall disobey thee, and not hearken to all thy commands which thou shalt give him let him be put to death. But be thou strong and courageous.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Joshua son of Nave had sent from Sat tin two young men to spy, saying, Go up, and take a view of the land, and particularly of Jericho. And the two young men, having set out, entered Jericho, and went to the house of a harlot, whose name was Rahab, and lodged there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And news being carried to the king of Jericho, saying, Some men of the children of Israel are come here to spy the land,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men, who came to thy house to night; for they are come to spy the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now the woman had taken the two men, and hid them: so she spoke to the messengers, saying, The men came to me;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>but at dark, when the gate was shutting, the men went out, and I do not know where they are gone. Pursue them: perhaps you may overtake them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now she had taken them up to the top of the house, and concealed them under flax, which was piled up for her on the top of the house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the men pursued them by the way to the Jordan, to the fords, and the gate was shut.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So when the pursuers were gone after them, she went up to the men, on the top of the house, before they had gone to sleep,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and said to them, I know that the Lord hath given you this land; for the dread of you is fallen upon us:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>for we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red sea on your account, when you came out of Egypt, and all that he hath done to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the borders of the Jordan, to Seon and Og, whom you have utterly destroyed:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and, upon hearing these things, we became faint hearted, and there was no spirit in any of us because of you. Since, then, the Lord your God is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>swear now to me by the Lord your God, because I shew mercy to you, that you will shew mercy to my father's house;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and that you will save alive my father's household, my mother, and my brothers, and all my family, and all that belong to them, and that you will deliver my soul from death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the men said to her, Our life for yours even to death. Then she said to them. When the Lord delivereth up to you this city, you will deal mercifully and truly with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So she lowered them down through a window.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now she said to them, Flee to the mountains, lest the pursuers meet you, and hide yourselves there three days, until they who are in pursuit of you have returned, and afterwards you may go your way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the men said to her, We are sincere in the oath which we have sworn to thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Behold when we enter any part of the city, thou shalt put up this signal; Thou shalt tye this scarlet rope to the window, through which thou shalt have let us down; and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy father's household, home to thy house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And it shall be that whoever goeth out of the door of thy house, into the street, shall incur the guilt of his own death, and we shall be clear of blame in regard to this oath which we have sworn to thee. But for all who are with thee in the house we will be answerable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But if any one injure us, or if thou disclose these our terms, we shall be clear of this oath to thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she said to them, Let it be as you say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So she dismissed them, and they went away, and came to the hilly country, and stayed there three days. And the pursuers examined all the roads, but did not find them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then the two young men turned, and came down from the mountain, and crossed over to Joshua son of Nave, and told him all that had happened to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they said to him, Because the Lord hath delivered up all that land into our hands, therefore all the inhabitants of the land are in the utmost consternation because of us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And after three days the officers went through the camp,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and gave a charge to the people, saying, When you see the Ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests, and the Levites carrying it, you shall remove from your places, and march after it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Joshua said to the people, Purify yourselves against to-morrow; for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and march before the people; and the priests had taken up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and were marching before the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>the Lord said to Joshua, This day I begin to exalt thee in the sight of all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Draw near, and hear the word of the Lord our God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth is about to cross the Jordan;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-61-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So the people removed from their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests carried the Ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-64-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the priests who carried the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood on dry ground, and all the children of Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had finished crossing the Jordan.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-74-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Accordingly these sons of Israel did as the Lord commanded Joshua, and having taken up twelve stones, out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the Israelites had done crossing, they carried them with them to the place of encampment, and deposited them there;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-75-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and Joshua caused twelve other stones to be placed in the Jordan, in the very spot under the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and they are there at this day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-239-10-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So Joshua went up from Galgala, he and all the people of war with him, every man of valour.</span></div>
