<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Whereas many have undertaken to compose a history of those things which have been accomplished among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>as they who were from the beginning eye witnesses, and are ministers of the word, have delivered them to us;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>it seemed good to me. also, when I had accurately traced every thing from the very first, immediately afterwards to write to thee, most excellent Theophilus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>that thou mayst know the certainty of those doctrines in which thou hast been instructed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was of the race of Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and precepts of the Lord, without blame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now they had no child, as Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And it came to pass that when he was performing the priest's office before God, in the order of his course,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>it fell to his lot, according to the order of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord, to burn incense,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>while the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of the incense offering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>at the sight of whom Zacharias was greatly discomposed and terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Whereupon the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife, Elizabeth, will bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He will indeed be to thee matter of joy and exultation; and many will rejoice at his birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must not drink wine, nor any fermented liquor. With a holy spirit he will be filled, even from his mother's womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He will go before in his presence, with the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and prepare disobedient persons, by a deep sense of righteous things, to be for the Lord a well disposed people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Thereupon Zacharias said to the angel, How can I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>In reply to which, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God: and I am sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee these glad tidings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now, behold, thou shalt be dumb and unable to speak, until the day when these tidings shall be accomplished; because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be confirmed in their season.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondered at his tarrying so long in the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And when he came out, he could not speak to them. So they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he made signs to them and continued deaf and dumb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived; and kept herself retired five months, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The Lord hath dealt thus with me in the days in which he looked on me to take away my reproach among men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And in the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>to a virgin contracted to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And when the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favourite of heaven! The Lord is with thee! Blessed thou among women!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Upon seeing him she was greatly discomposed at his speech, and revolved in her mind what sort of a salutation this might be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Whereupon the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary. For thou hast found favour with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now behold thou shall conceive, and bear a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>He will be great and will be called the son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I know not man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And the angel answering, said to her, A holy spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee, therefore the holy offspring will be called the son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Now behold Elizabeth thy cousin, even she hath conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her, who hath been called barren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>For with God nothing is impossible.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Thereupon Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to thy word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And the angel left her. And in those days Mary set out and travelled with speed to the hill country, to a city of Juda,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>and went to the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And soon as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb: and Elizabeth was filled with a holy spirit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>and with a loud acclamation said, Blessed thou among women! and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>How have I this honour, that the mother of my Lord should come to me!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>For behold! soon as the sound of thy salutation reached mine ear, the babe within me leaped for joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Happy indeed is she who believed that there shall be an accomplishment of the things spoken to her from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>and my spirit exulteth in God, my Saviour:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>because he hath regarded the low condition of his handmaid. For behold! henceforth all generations will call me happy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Because the Mighty One hath done great things for me; therefore hallowed be his name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Indeed his mercy on them who fear him, extendeth to generations of generations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>With his arm he hath displayed strength. He hath scattered them who were elated with the imagination of their heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-1-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>From thrones he hath hurled potentates, and exalted them of low degree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-1-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and sent away the rich empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-55-1-54'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>He hath supported his servant Israel, remembering (as he spoke to our fathers) mercy</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-1-55'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>for Abraham and his seed forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-1-56'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>And Mary abode with her about three months, and then returned home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-1-57'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Now when the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she8 brought forth a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-59-1-58'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>And her neighbours and her relations, hearing that the Lord had magnified his mercy to her, rejoiced with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-1-59'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-61-1-60'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>But his mother interposing, said, No. He shall be called John.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-63-1-62'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>Then they made signs to his father to know what he would have him called.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-64-1-63'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>And he, having demanded a table book, wrote, saying, His name is John. At which they were all surprised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-65-1-64'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>And his mouth was immediately opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-84-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it happened in those days, that an edict came forth from Caesar Augustus, that this whole inhabited land should be enrolled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-85-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>This was the first enrolment; it was made when Cyrenius was a governor of Syria;</span></div>
