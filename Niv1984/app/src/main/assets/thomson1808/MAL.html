<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The charge of the word of the Lord to Israel by the ministry of his messenger. Lay it up in your hearts I beseech you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I have loved you, saith the Lord. But you said, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau the brother of Jacob? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and slighted Esau and made his borders a waste, and the houses of a desert his inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For should he say, Idumea is overthrown, let us return and build up the waste cities. Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Let them build, but I will overturn. They shall indeed be surnamed The borders of iniquity and A people to whom the Lord hath ever been opposed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And your eyes shall see and you will say, The Lord is magnified far beyond the borders of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>A son honoureth a father; and a servant, his master. Now if I be a father, where is my honour? And if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord Almighty. As for you priests, you are they who bring dishonour on my name. Do you say, By what have we brought dishonour on thy name?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>By offering on mine altar polluted loaves. And do you say, How have we polluted them? When you said, The table of the Lord is polluted, you then caused no regard to be paid to that which was to be laid thereon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Since, if you offer the blind for sacrifices, it is not evil; and if you offer the lame or sickly, it is not evil. Offer such now to thy governor, will he admit thee? Will he accept thy person? saith the Lord Almighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now then do you conciliate the favour of your God when you supplicate him? When such offerings are made by your hands, shall I for your sakes accept your persons? saith the Lord Almighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Since by you the doors will be shut, and a fire will not be kindled on mine altar for nothing, I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord Almighty; nor will I accept a sacrifice at your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Since from the risings of the sun to its goings down my name hath been glorified among the nations; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice; since my name is great among the nations, saith the Lord Almighty,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and you profane it, by your saying, The table of the Lord is polluted, and when no regard was paid to the offerings laid thereon his meats,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>you said, These are because of affliction, and though I rejected them, saith the Lord Almighty, yet you offered the torn, the lame and the sickly; if then you bring this sacrifice shall I accept such at your hands, saith the Lord Almighty,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>when he is cursed, who is of ability and who hath a male in his flock and his vow upon him, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupted thing? Because I am a great king, saith the Lord Almighty and my name is illustrious among the nations,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>now therefore this command is for you, priests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>If you will not hearken and if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, saith the Lord Almighty, I will send that curse against you and curse your blessing. I will curse it; and disperse your blessing and it shall not be among you because you do not lay this to heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Behold I set apart for you the shoulder, now I will scatter the great intestine on your faces the great intestine of your festivals and take you to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now you must know, since I sent this command to you to be my covenant with the Levites, saith the Lord Almighty,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>that my covenant of life and peace was with him; and I gave it to him that I might be greatly feared and that he might be awed at my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The law of truth was in his mouth: and iniquity should not have been found in his lips. Walking uprightly with me in peace, he indeed turned many from iniquity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Because the lips of a priest were to keep knowledge therefore law was to be sought from his mouth; since he is a messenger of the Lord Almighty:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but as for you, you have turned aside out of the way and weakened many by law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord Almighty,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>therefore I have made you contemptible and outcasts among all the nations, because you did not keep my ways, but in law have had respect to persons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Have you not all one father? Hath not one God created you? Why then have you forsaken every one his brother? For profaning the covenant of your fathers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Juda was forsaken. There was indeed abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem, because Juda profaned the holy things of the Lord in which he delighted and studiously went after strange gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The Lord will cut off the man who doth such things until he be humbled from the dwellings of Jacob and from among them who offer a sacrifice to the Lord Almighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Moreover you have done those things which I hate. You have covered the altar of the Lord with tears. And amidst lamentations and groans for oppression is it still proper to look upon a sacrifice, or receive it acceptably at your hands?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And do you say, Why not? Because God was a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth whom thou hast forsaken, though she was thy companion and the wife of thy covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now did not he who had the residue of spirit, do right? Yet you have said, What else but a seed doth God require? But keep this in your mind, Thou must not forsake the wife of thy youth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But if thou having hated shalt put away saith the Lord God of Israel. And will impiety, saith the Lord Almighty, put a cloak over thy lusts? Therefore keep this in your mind, You must not forsake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>You have provoked God with your sayings. And do you ask, By what have we provoked him? By your saying, Every one doing evil doth that which is good in the sight of the Lord. Now were he well pleased with such; where then is the God of Righteousness?</span></div>
