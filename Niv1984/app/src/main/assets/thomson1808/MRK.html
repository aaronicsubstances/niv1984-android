<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make the roads for him straight,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>John came baptizing in the wilderness, and proclaiming a baptism of reformation, for a remission of sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And all the country of Judea and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now John's clothing was of camel's hair and he had a leathern girdle about his waist. And his food was locusts and wild honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he proclaimed saying, There is one coming after me, who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I indeed have baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in a holy spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized in the Jordan, by John,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>who immediately upon his coming up from the water, saw the heavens parted asunder, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And there came a voice from the heavens, Thou art my Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Presently after this the Spirit sendeth him forth into the wilderness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And after John's imprisonment, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the glad tidings of the reign of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and saying, The time is accomplished, and the reign of God is at hand. Reform and confide in this good news.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And as he was walking along the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag net, into the sea; for they were fishermen;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>and Jesus said to them, Come with me and I will make you fishers of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Thereupon they straightway left their nets and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And going thence a little further, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in the vessel, mending the nets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And soon as he called them, they left their father Zebedee in the vessel, with the hired servants, and went after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And they come to Capernaum; and thenceforward on the sabbath days, he went to the synagogue and taught;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>and they were astonished at his manner of teaching; for he taught as one having authority and not as the Scribes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried aloud,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>saying, Forbear! what hast thou to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art; the Holy One of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Thereupon Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent and go out of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the unclean spirit, having convulsed the man, and screamed with a loud voice, went out of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>At which all were so amazed, that they asked one another, saying, What is this? What new teaching is this? For with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And thenceforth his fame spread through all the region of Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Immediately on their going out of the synagogue they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And as Simon's mother in law was confined to her bed with a fever, they forthwith spake to him about her;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>whereupon he went to her, and taking hold of her hand, raised her up, and instantly the fever left her, and she waited on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And in the evening, when the sun was set, they brought to him all their sick, and those who were possessed by demons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And the whole city was assembled at the door.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And he healed many who were sick of various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he permitted not the demons to say they knew him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And in the morning, when the night was far advanced, he arose and went out, and retired to a solitary place, and there prayed;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>and Simon, and they who were with him, went in quest of him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>and having found him they say to him, They are all seeking thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Whereupon he saith to them, Let us go to the neighbouring villages, that I may there also make proclamation, for I am come forth for that purpose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Accordingly he proceeded, proclaiming the news in their synagogues, through all Galilee, and casting out demons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And there cometh to him a leper, who on his knees intreated him, saying, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And Jesus had compassion, and stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou cleansed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And while he was speaking, the leprosy instantly left the man, and he was cleansed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Then having restrained him, he sent him away immediately,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>saying to him, See thou say nothing to any one; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification what Moses hath commanded, for a testimony to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>But when he went out he began to proclaim freely and publish the matter abroad, so that Jesus could no more go openly into a city, but continued without in solitary places, where people resorted to him from all quarters.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-49-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After some days he again entered Capernaum, and the report spread that he was in a house,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-50-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and such multitudes presently flocked thither, that even the courts before the door could not contain them. And while he was speaking the word to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>some come to him bringing a paralytic, carried by four men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And not being able to come near to him by reason of the crowd, they drew back the covering over the place where he was, and having opened a passage they lowered down the couch on which the paralytic lay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-53-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Upon seeing their faith, Jesus saith to the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-54-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now there were some of the Scribes sitting there, and they were reasoning in their minds</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Thereupon Jesus, perceiving immediately by his spirit that they are thus reasoning in themselves, said to them, Why do ye reason thus in your hearts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Which is easier, To say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But that you may know that the son of man hath power on the earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the paralytic)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-62-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now as he passed on he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting at the custom house, and saith to him, Follow me. Whereupon he arose and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-63-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And it came to pass that when Jesus was at table, in this man's house, many publicans and sinners were at table, with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-64-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When the Scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with these publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, What! Doth he eat and drink with these publicans and sinners!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-65-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>This being in the hearing of Jesus, he saith to them, They who are in health have no need of a physician; but they who are sick.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-66-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now it was customary for the disciples of John, and those of the Pharisees, to fast.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-67-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Thereupon Jesus said to them, Can the bridemen fast, while the bridegroom is with them? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-72-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Whereupon the Pharisees said to him, See! Why are they doing what is not lawful, on the sabbath days?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-74-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>How he went to the house of God in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, and ate the presence loaves, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave thereof to his attendants?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-75-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Moreover he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-117-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he taught them many things in parables. and in his manner of teaching, said to them, Hearken!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-118-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Behold the sower went out to sow!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-119-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And it happened that as he was sowing, some fell on the highway, and the birds of the air came and devoured it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-120-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much depth of soil; and it sprang up immediately, because it had not depth of soil,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-121-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>but when the sun was up, it was scorched, and, for want of root, withered away:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-122-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it, so that it yielded no fruit:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-123-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and some fell on good ground, which sprang up and yielded fruit, growing and thriving and bringing forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred fold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-124-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he said to them, Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-125-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And when he was in private they who were about him. with the twelve, asked him the meaning of this parable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-126-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Whereupon he said to them, To you it is granted to know the secrets of the reign of God; but to those without, all these things are delivered in parables,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-127-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>so that seeing they see, though they may not perceive; and hearing they hear, though they may not understand. Perhaps they may turn, that their sins may be forgiven them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-128-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then he saith to them, Do ye not comprehend this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-129-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The sower soweth the word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-130-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, who have no sooner heard, than Satan cometh, and taketh away the word which was sown in their hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-131-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And in like manner the rocky ground denoteth those, who, when they hear the word, receive it immediately with joy;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-132-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>but not having it rooted in them, they are but temporary; so that when tribulation, or persecution cometh because of the word, they are instantly stumbled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-133-4-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And these are they sown among thorns, who hear the word,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-134-4-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>but the cares of this world, and the delusion of riches, and inordinate desires of other things, crowd in and choke the word, so that it becometh unfruitful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-135-4-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And these are they sown on good ground, who hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some, thirty; and some, sixty; and some, an hundred fold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-136-4-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under the corn measure, or under the bed? Is it not that it may be set on a stand?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-137-4-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be discovered, nor any thing laid up in secret, but that it may be brought to light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-138-4-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-139-4-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Moreover he said to them, Consider what you hear. With whatever measure you deal out, you shall receive; and to you who are attentive more shall be given.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-140-4-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For to him who improveth, more shall be given; but from him who improveth not, even what he hath shall be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-141-4-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Again he said, The reign of God is as when a man soweth seed on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-142-4-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Whether he sleepeth or waketh, night and day, the seed groweth and increaseth, he knoweth not how.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-143-4-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For the earth of itself produceth first a blade, then an ear, then full grains in the ear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-144-4-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And when the grain is ripe, he forthwith applieth the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-145-4-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Again he said, To what may we compare the reign of God? Or by what similitude may we represent it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-146-4-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the ground, is one of the very smallest seeds there:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-147-4-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>but, being sown, it springeth up and becometh larger than all plants of the pulse kind, and shooteth out large branches, so that under its shade the birds of the air can find shelter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-148-4-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And with many such parables he spake the word to them as they were able to hear it:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-149-4-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>but without a parable he did not speak to them. And in private he explained all to his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-150-4-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And the same day, in the evening, he saith to them. Let us cross over to the other side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-151-4-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>So, leaving the multitude, they take him along with them as he was on board. And there were some other small vessels with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-152-4-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And there arose a violent storm of wind, and the waves beat into the vessel, so that it would soon be full.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-153-4-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Now he was in the stem, asleep on a pillow. And they awake him, and say, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-154-4-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Thereupon he arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-155-4-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then he said to them, Why are you so much afraid. How is it that you have not faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-156-4-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And they were exceedingly terrified, and said one to another, Who in reality is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-160-5-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>just as he was stepping out of the vessel, there met him a man coming out from among the tombs, with an unclean spirit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-161-5-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>who made his abode in the tombs, and whom no one could confine; no, not even with chains.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-165-5-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>cried with a loud voice, saying, What hast thou to do with me, Jesus, son of the most high God? I conjure thee by God not to torment me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-166-5-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For he had said to him, Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-167-5-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion; for we are many,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-168-5-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and earnestly intreated him not to send them out of that country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-169-5-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now there was there on the mountains, a great herd of swine feeding,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-170-5-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and all the demons besought him, saying, Send us to the swine that we may enter into them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-171-5-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Jesus immediately permitted them.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-172-5-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they who fed the swine fled, and told the news in town and country. And the people came out to see what had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-173-5-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when they came to Jesus and saw the demoniac; him who had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind, they were terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-174-5-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And when the eye witnesses told them what was done to the demoniac, and respecting the swine,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-175-5-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>they began to intreat him to withdraw from their territories.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-176-5-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And as he was going on board the vessel the late demoniac besought him that he might go with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-177-5-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But Jesus did not permit him, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them what the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-180-5-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And behold there cometh to him one of the rulers of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, who, upon seeing him, falleth at his feet</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-182-5-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So Jesus went with him, followed by a great multitude which pressed about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-183-5-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And a certain woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with an issue of blood,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-185-5-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>having heard of Jesus, came behind him, in the crowd, and touched his mantle.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-188-5-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Thereupon Jesus conscious of the power which had gone forth from him, turning about immediately, in the crowd, said, Who touched my clothes?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-189-5-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Upon which his disciples said to him, Thou seest how the crowd throng thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-190-5-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Still he looked round to see her who had done this,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-191-5-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>when the woman, knowing what had been done for her, came trembling with fear, and prostrating herself before him, told him the whole truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-192-5-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Whereupon he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath cured thee. Go in peace, and continue cured of that disorder of thine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-193-5-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Now while he was speaking, messengers came from the ruler's house, who said, Thy daughter is dead, why troublest thou the teacher any further?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-194-5-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Upon hearing this message delivered, Jesus immediately saith to the ruler of the synagogue,57 Be not afraid. Only believe.</span></div>
