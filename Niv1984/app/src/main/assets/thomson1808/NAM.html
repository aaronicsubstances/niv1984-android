<h2 id='thomson1808-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The sentence on Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elkosite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>God is zealous. The Lord is about to take vengeance: the Lord is about to take vengeance with wrath: the Lord is about to take vengeance on his adversaries, and to destroy utterly his enemies, himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The Lord is slow to anger, though his power is great; will not the Lord then acquit the innocent? Is his way in destruction and whirlwind, when clouds are the dust of his feet? (An objection, The answer)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When he rebuketh the sea he maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel are diminished and the bloom of Libanus languished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>At him the mountains quake and the hills tremble; at his presence the earth is startled; the world and all its inhabitants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>At the presence of his wrath who can stand, or who can resist his fierce indignation? His wrath dissolveth governments, and by him the rocks are rent to pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Lord is kind to them who wait for him in a day of distress: and he knoweth them who reverence him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When with a deluging march he maketh destruction; them who raise themselves up and are his enemies, darkness shall pursue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>What are you devising against the Lord? He will make complete destruction, and not punish twice by distress for the same thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Because one shall be utterly destroyed, and consumed like bindweed and dry stubble;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>shall a reasoning against the Lord proceed from thee; wicked city, devising things in opposition?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Thus saith the Lord, With respect to the ruler of many waters! they shall be so dispersed, that what thou hearest shall be heard no more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I will now break his sceptre from thee, and burst the bands asunder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Concerning thee the Lord will command, let none of thy name be sown any more. From the house of thy God I will root out the graven and molten images; I will make it a sepulchre for thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Because yonder on the mountain are the swift feet of one bringing good news: even of one announcing peace; O Juda, solemnize thy festivals; pay thy vows; for they shall no more proceed to pass through thee for conflict. It is completely laid waste, entirely removed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Into thy presence came up panting one who is delivered from affliction. Watch the way; strengthen thy loins; act manfully with all thy might,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>since the Lord hath averted contumely from Jacob, as he did reproach from Israel, since emptiers have emptied them out and destroyed their branches;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>As for Ninive, her waters are like a standing pool. They who fled away made no halt, nor was there one who looked back.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>where is the habitation of the lions, and the feeding places of the young lions? Where had the old lions gone, that a young lion entered and there was none to scare him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The old lion had seized enough for his whelps, and had strangled for his lionesses, and had filled his hole with prey, and his den with ravin:</span></div>
