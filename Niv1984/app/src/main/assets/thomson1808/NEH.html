<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Anani, one of my brethren, came with certain men of Juda, and I inquired of them concerning the remnant who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Upon hearing this report, I sat down and wept and mourned some days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and I said, I beseech thee, Lord, God of heaven, the Mighty, the Great and the Awful, who keepest thy covenant and thy mercy with them who love thee and keep thy commandments,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>let thine ear, I beseech thee, be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayst hear the prayer of thy servant which I now make before thee day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and plead for their sins which we have committed against thee.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We have broken covenant with thee, and have not kept the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou gavest in charge to thy servant Moses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>and in the month Nisan of the twentieth year of king Arthasastha, the wine being before me, I took the wine, and when I had given it to the king (now there was none besides me in waiting)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, and thou not at thine ease? this is nothing but grief of heart. At this I was greatly terrified</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and said to the king, Let the king live forever! Why should not my countenance be sad, seeing the city, the house of my father's sepulchre, is in a state of desolation, and the gates thereof burned with fire?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Thereupon the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? And when I had prayed to the God of heaven,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Upon this the king said to me (now his concubine was sitting by him) For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? So the king being pleased to send me, I set him a time</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and said to the king, If it seemeth good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors beyond the river, that they may conduct me on in my journey till I come to Juda;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and I came to the governors beyond the river, and delivered them the king's letters. Now the king sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and I went out at the gate Golela on to the mouth of the well of fig trees, and on to the dung gate, tracing the wall of Jerusalem which had been demolished, and the gates of which were burned with fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then I passed on to the gate of Ain and to the king's pool. But there being no place for the beast under me to pass,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>I continued going up by night along the wall of the valley. And having hastily traced the wall, and come to the valley gate, I returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the watchmen did not know why I went nor what I was doing; for I had not yet told the Jews, nor the priests, nor the nobles, nor the officers of the army, nor the rest who were to do the work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then I said to them, You see the distress in which we are!

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when I told them of the good hand of God which was upon me, and the words which the king spoke to me, and said, Let us arise and build; their hands were strengthened for this good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But when Sanaballat the Aronite, and Tobia the servant the Ammonite and Gesem the Arab heard, they laughed at us, and came to us and said, What is this which you are doing?

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>In reply to which I said, The God of heaven will prosper us, as we his servants are pure and will go on with the building; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.</span></div>
