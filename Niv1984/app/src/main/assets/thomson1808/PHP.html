<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>favour be to you and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I thank my God at every mention of you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>always, in ever prayer of mine for you all, making such supplication with joy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>for your contribution for the glad tidings; having from the first day till now</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>the same confidence, that he who hath begun a good work in you will continue completing it until the day of Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>as it is just for me to be thus affected towards you all, because you have me in your heart; and in my bonds and in the defence and support of the glad tidings you all continue to be fellow sharers with me of this favour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For God be my witness how tenderly I love you all with the affection of Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and this I pray that your love may abound still more and more, in knowledge and all discernment,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>that you may prove the things which differ; that you may be sincere and inoffensive till the day of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>filled with fruits of righteousness, which are by means of Jesus Christ, for the glory and praise of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now I wish you, brethren, to know that what hath happened to me hath rather conduced to the furtherance of the</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>gospel; so that in the whole imperial palace, and all other places, my bonds are well known to be for Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and a greater number of the brethren in the Lord are emboldened by my bonds to venture to speak the word with more freedom and intrepidity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Some indeed proclaim the Christ out of envy and contention, but others do it out of good will</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>the former for the sake of strife proclaim the Christ not in a pure manner, thinking to add affliction to my bonds;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>but the latter for love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>What then? Still in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. At this therefore I rejoice and will rejoice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For I know that this will issue in my deliverance, through your supplications and a supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall in no wise be ashamed; but that in the most open manner, as always so now, Christ shall be magnified in my body, either by life or by death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But whether the living in flesh is for me a fruit of labour, and what I should chuse, I do not know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For I am strained between the two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is by far the best;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>but to abide in the flesh is more needful on your account.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And being confident of this, I know that I shall abide and continue some time with you all for your furtherance and joy in the faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>that by me your glorying in Christ Jesus may abound, by means of my being present with you again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Only conduct yourselves in a manner becoming the glad tidings of the Christ, that whether I come and see you, or if absent I may hear this of you, that you are stedfast in one spirit, and that without being in the least daunted by your opposers, you contend unanimously for the belief of the gospel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>which is to them indeed a manifestation of destruction, but to you, of salvation. Now with respect to this from God</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>because this hath been granted to you for Christ, not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him and you are engaged in the same conflict as that in which you saw me and now hear that I am engaged,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>who being in the form of God did not think it robbery to be like God,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even the death of a cross;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>wherefore God highly exalted him, and granted him a name which is above every name,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, as you, my beloved, have always been obedient, not only when I was present, but now much more when I am absent, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>for it is God who is working in you both the will and the power to act.</span></div>
