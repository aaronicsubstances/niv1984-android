<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And all who practise this have good understanding.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For they hated wisdom and did not chuse the word of the Lord:</span></div>
