There is in the Septuagint another Psalm, with this title: This Psalm on David was written by himself in prose, when he fought in single combat with Goliath. I was little among my brethren, and the youngest of my father's family. I fed my father's flocks. My hands had made an organ; and my fingers had tuned a psaltery. But who will tell my Lord. My Lord himself heareth. He sent his messenger and took me from my father's flocks and anointed me with anointing oil. My brothers were comely and great; but the Lord did not delight in them. I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. But I drew his own sword and cut off his head, and took away reproach from the children of Israel.</span></div>
