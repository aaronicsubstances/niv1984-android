<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of the Christ; for it is the power of God for salvation to every one who believeth, to the Jew in the first place, and also to the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For by it there is revealed a justification of God's appointment because of belief, that we may believe. As it is written, But the just shall live because of belief:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>therefore God gave them up to infamous passions; for even their women perverted the instinct of nature;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and in like manner the males also leaving the sex, were inflamed with desires towards each other, which they most shamefully indulged, men with men, and received in themselves the retribution which was justly due to their error.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And as they did not search out God to have constantly a due sense of him, God gave them up to an undiscerning mind to do things unseemly,</span></div>
