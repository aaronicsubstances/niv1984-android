<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when the Judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man went from Bethlehem Juda to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Noemin, and the names of his two sons, Maalon and Chelaion. They were Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. They went to the country of Moab, and while they were there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Elimelech, the husband of Noemin, died, and she was left with her two sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And they took for themselves wives of the daughters of Moab, the name of the one was Orpha, and the name of the other Ruth. And when they had dwelt there about ten years,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>both Maalon and Chelaion died, so that the woman was bereaved of her husband, and her two sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Whereupon she arose with her two daughters in law, and set out on her return from the country of Moab; for she had heard, in the country of Moab, that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters in law. And when they had travelled some part of the way on their return to the land of Juda,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Noemin said to her two daughters in law, Go, I pray you, return each to her mother's house. May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have done with the dead, and with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The Lord grant, that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband. So she kissed them, and they wept aloud,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and said to her, We will go back with thee to thy people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Noemin said, Return, I pray you, my daughters! for why should you go with me? Have I yet any more sons in my womb to be husbands for you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Return, I pray you, my daughters! For I am too old to have a husband; for should I say, I am in condition to marry, and should I bear sons,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>would you wait for them till they grow up; or should you be restrained by them from having husbands? No, my daughters. Indeed it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the Lord hath gone forth against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And when they had raised their voice, and wept again, Orpha kissed her mother in law, and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Noemin said to Ruth; Behold thy sister in law is gone back to her people, and to her gods, return thou also, I pray thee, after thy sister in law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Whereupon Ruth said, Force me not to leave thee, nor to return from following thee; for whither soever thou goest, I will go; and wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people; and thy God, my God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>and wherever thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me and more also, if any thing but death shall part me and thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when Noemin saw that she was steadfastly determined to go with her, she refrained from speaking to her any more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So they both proceeded on till they came to Bethlehem. And when they arrived at Bethlehem, all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Noemin?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But she said to them, Call me not, I pray you, Noemin. Call me, Bitter: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I went out full; but the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why therefore do you call me Noemin, seeing the Lord hath brought me low, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Thus Noemin returned, with Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law; and having returned from the country of Moab, they came to Bethlehem, at the beginning of the barley harvest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-26-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Noemin had a kinsman of her husband's; a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Noemin, Let me go, I pray thee, into the field, and glean among the stubble after him in whose eyes I shall find favour. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So she went, and coming into a field, gleaned after the reapers. Now she happened to light upon the part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And behold Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The Lord be with you! And they said to him, The Lord bless thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-30-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Boaz said to his servant, who was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is that?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the servant who was over the reapers said in reply, It is the Moabitess girl, who came with Noemin from the country of Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>She said, Let me, I pray thee, glean, and gather among the sheaves after the reapers. So she came, and hath been on her feet from early in the morning, and is continuing on till evening. She hath not rested a moment in the field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Thou must not go to glean in any other field, nor must thou go hence, but abide here fast by my maids,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-34-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>let thy eyes be on the field where they reap and go after them. Behold I have given a charge to my servants not to touch thee, and when thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of what the servants have drawn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-35-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Upon which she fell on her face, and made an obeisance to the ground, and said to him, How have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldst take notice of me, seeing I am a stranger?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Boaz in reply said to her, I have been fully informed of all that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father, and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, to come to a people whom thou knewest not heretofore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The Lord recompense thy work, and may a full reward be given thee by the Lord God of Israel, to whom thou art come, to put thy trust under his wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my Lord, for thou hast comforted me. Now because thou hast spoken affectionately to thy servant, behold let me therefore be like one of thy maid servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-39-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Boaz said to her, It is now meal time, draw near, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So Ruth sat down by the side of the reapers. And Boaz helped her to a large piece of barley bread, so that she eat, and was satisfied, and had some left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-40-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when she arose to glean, Boaz gave a charge to his servants, saying, Let her glean among the sheaves, and put her not to the blush.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-41-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And when you carry out, carry out for her. Leave also for her some out of the bundles, and let her eat, and glean, and rebuke her not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-42-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So she gleaned in the field till evening, and beat out what she had gathered, and it was about an epha of barley.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-43-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And she took it up, and went to the city. And when her mother in law saw what she had gathered, and Ruth had taken out, and given her some of the bread that was left after she had been satisfied,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-44-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>her mother in law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? And where hast thou been at work? Blessed be he who hath taken notice of thee. And when Ruth told her mother in law where she had been at work, and said, The man's name is Boaz, with whom I worked to day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-45-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Noemin said to her daughter in law, Blessed is he of the Lord, because he hath not dropped his kindness to the living, nor to the dead. Then Noemin said to her, The man is near of kin to us. He is one of our nearest relations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-46-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Ruth said to her mother in law, Indeed he also said to me, Thou must keep close by my maids till they finish my whole harvest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-47-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Noemin said to her daughter in law Ruth, it is good my daughter that thou hast gone out with his maids, therefore let them not meet thee in another field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-48-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So Ruth kept fast by the maids of Boaz, to glean till they finished the barley and wheat harvest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-51-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then she abode at home with her mother in law. And Noemin her mother in law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek a rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-52-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now is not Boaz our relation, with whose girls thou hast been? Behold he is winnowing barley in the threshing floor.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-56-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So she went up to the threshing floor, and did all that her mother in law commanded her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-57-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when Boaz had eaten, and drunk, and his heart was cheered, he went and lay down at the side of a heap of corn. Then she went in softly and uncovered his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-58-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And in the middle of the night the man was astonished, and troubled, for lo! a woman was lying at his feet.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-60-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Boaz said, Blessed art thou of the Lord God, my daughter; for thou hast shewn more kindness in this last act than in the former, in not going after young men either poor or rich.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-61-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now therefore, my daughter, be not afraid, I will do for thee all thou hast said; for all the tribe of my people know that thou art a virtuous woman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-62-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now indeed it is true that I am a near relation; but there is a relation nearer of kin than I.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-63-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Tarry this night, and it shall be, in the morning; that if he perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well: let him do so.

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-64-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So she lay at his feet till the morning, and arose before one could know another. And Boaz said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-65-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then he said to her, Bring the sash which is girt about thee. So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her, and went to the city.</span></div>

And behold when the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken was passing by, Boaz said to him, Turn aside and sit down here thou hidden man. So he turned aside, and sat down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-72-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-74-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I have promised to open thine ear, saying, Purchase it in the presence of these men who are sitting here, even in the presence of the elders of my people.
