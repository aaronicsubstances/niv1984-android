<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>in hope of an everlasting life, which the God of truth promised before the times consisting of ages,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and in his own times promulgated as his word, by a proclamation with which I am entrusted, according to the appointment of the saviour our God;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For the overseer ought to be blameless as God's steward, not self willed, not passionate, not addicted to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy of sordid gain;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but a lover of hospitality, a lover of goodness, sober, just, holy, temperate,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are many who are disorderly, vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='thomson1808-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>who ought to be curbed, who subvert whole houses teaching what they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.</span></div>
