## Building Android App

Create **app-debug.properties** and **app-release.properties** files besides the **app.properties** file for debug and release build variants respectively in order to specify a base API endpoint and optionally credentials for use by mobile app.

For release builds also create a **keystore.properties** file inside *Niv1984* folder to have the following properties:

* storePassword

* keyPassword

* keyAlias

* storeFile

### Build Environment

* Android Studio Koala


## Debugging

Setting the LogCat window of Android Studio to `name:: c.a.n.` gets the logs generated by the configured SLF4J in Niv1984/app/src/main/assets/logback.xml.
