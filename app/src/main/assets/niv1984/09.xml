        <verse num="1">
            <content>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite </content>
            <note_ref>1</note_ref>
            <content> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. </content>

            <content> </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, </content>
            <note_ref>3</note_ref>
            <content> saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>"Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his </content>
            <note_ref>4</note_ref>
            <content> word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, </content>
            <note_ref>5</note_ref>
            <content> an ephah </content>

            <content> of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="25">
            <content>When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="26">
            <content>and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</content>

        <verse num="27">
            <content>I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</content>

            <content>So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there. </content>

            <content>Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they </content>

            <content>Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</content>

            <content>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</content>

            <content>No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people.</content>

            <content> may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="26">
            <content>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</content>

            <content>Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</content>

        <verse num="28">
            <content>I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.</content>

        <verse num="29">
            <content>Why do you </content>
            <note_ref>6</note_ref>
            <content> scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="30">
            <content>"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: `I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</content>

            <content>The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line</content>

            <content>There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the Israelites--a head taller than any of the others.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>The servant answered him again. "Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a shekel </content>

            <content>As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"</content>

        <verse num="12">
            <content>"He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.</content>

            <content>As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat.

        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel:</content>

            <content>"About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked upon my people, for their cry has reached me."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."</content>

            <content>Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and all your father's family?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited--about thirty in number.</content>

            <content>Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside."</content>

            <content>So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, `I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.</content>

        <verse num="25">
            <content>After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.</content>

            <content>They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.</content>

        <verse num="27">
            <content>As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us"--and the servant did so--"but you stay here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God."</content>

        <verse num="1">
            <content>The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>The commanders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish replied, "Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>But the Philistine commanders were angry with him and said, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master's favor than by taking the heads of our own men?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>Isn't this the David they sang about in their dances: "`Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>So Achish called David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don't approve of you.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>Turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>"But what have I done?" asked David. "What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can't I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Achish answered, "I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, `He must not go up with us into battle.'</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>Now get up early, along with your master's servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</content>

        <verse num="1">
            <content>David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>David's two wives had been captured--Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.</content>

        <verse num="7">
            <content>Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to him,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>and David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" "Pursue them," he answered. "You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some stayed behind,</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.</content>

        <verse num="11">
            <content>They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat--</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?" He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.</content>

        <verse num="14">
            <content>We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and the territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag."</content>

            <content>David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.</content>

        <verse num="18">
            <content>David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.</content>

            <content>He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David and his men approached, he greeted them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us.</content>

        <verse num="24">
            <content>Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."</content>

        <verse num="25">
            <content>David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.</content>

            <content>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.</content>

            <content>Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</content>
