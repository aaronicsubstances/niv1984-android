        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses </content>

            <content> and David's special guard did not join Adonijah.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">

        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowing it?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>Go in to King David and say to him, `My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.</content>

        <verse num="17">
            <content>She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: `Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.'</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>And they told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?</content>

        <verse num="25">
            <content>Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, `Long live King Adonijah!'</content>

            <content>Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="28">
            <content>Then King David said, "Call in Bathsheba." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="29">
            <content>The king then took an oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,</content>

        <verse num="30">
            <content>I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="31">
            <content>Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, "May my lord King David live forever!"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="32">
            <content>King David said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="33">
            <content>he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="34">
            <content>There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, `Long live King Solomon!'</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="35">
            <content>Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="36">
            <content>Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="37">
            <content>As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="38">
            <content>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="39">

            <content>And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="41">
            <content>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="42">
            <content>Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="43">
            <content>"Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king.</content>

        <verse num="44">
            <content>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule,</content>

            <content>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.</content>

        <verse num="48">
            <content>and said, `Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'"</content>

            <content>Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, `Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"</content>

            <content>The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword.

            <content>King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter--Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.</content>

        <verse num="2">
            <content>They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.</content>

        <verse num="5">

            <content>On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.</content>

            <content>The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.</content>

            <content>So the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.</content>

            <content>Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."</content>

            <content>Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.</content>

            <content>Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.</content>

            <content>They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.</content>

        <verse num="20">
            <content>The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh's own children.</content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me go, that I may return to my own country."</content>

        <verse num="22">
            <content>"What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad replied, "but do let me go!"</content>

        <verse num="23">
            <content>And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.</content>

        <verse num="26">
            <content>Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.</content>

            <content>But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?"</content>

        <verse num="4">
            <content>So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</content>

            <content>So the king of Israel brought together the prophets--about four hundred men--and asked them, "Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">

            <content>The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad.

        <verse num="19">
            <content>Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.</content>
