        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.</content>

            <content>On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him--Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas--</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>But when the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>and were closest to the king--Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>"According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, `King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.'</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>"Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memucan proposed.</content>

        <verse num="22">
            <content>He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, proclaiming in each people's tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household.</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.</content>

        <verse num="5">
            <content>Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,</content>

            <content>Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl, who was also known as Esther, was lovely in form and features, and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the king's palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.</content>

            <content>Before a girl's turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.</content>

        <verse num="13">
            <content>And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.</content>

            <content>In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</content>

        <verse num="17">
            <content>Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.</content>

            <content>After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles.</content>

        <verse num="2">
            <content>All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>Then the royal officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, they cast the pur (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Then Haman said to King Xerxes, "There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the king's laws; it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will put ten thousand talents </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="10">

        <verse num="12">
            <content>Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.</content>

        <verse num="13">
            <content>Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews--young and old, women and little children--on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>Spurred on by the king's command, the couriers went out, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.</content>

            <content>In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</content>

            <content>When Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.</content>

            <content>Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.</content>

            <content>He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to urge her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.</content>

            <content>For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?"</content>
