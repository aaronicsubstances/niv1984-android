            <content>"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." </content>

            <content>What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?</content>

            <content>The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.</content>

            <content>The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.</content>

            <content>All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.</content>

        <verse num="9">
            <content>What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</content>

            <content>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</content>

        <verse num="16">
            <content>I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.</content>

        <verse num="1">
            <content>I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>"Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly--my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem </content>
            <note_ref>1</note_ref>
            <content> as well--the delights of the heart of man.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun. </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="25">
            <content>for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?</content>

        <verse num="26">
            <content>To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</content>

            <content>There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless-- a miserable business! </content>
