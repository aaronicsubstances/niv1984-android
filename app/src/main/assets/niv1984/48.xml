            <content>I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.</content>

            <content>Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," </content>
            <note_ref>7</note_ref>
            <content> meaning one person, who is Christ.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ </content>
