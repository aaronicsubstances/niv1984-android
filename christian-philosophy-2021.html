    <h1>Word from Author</h1>
    I am excited that you have downloaded this bible application in order to connect with God. Connecting with God is the important activity you will engage in, because its consequences will carry you far into life after death in one direction or the other.  
    <p> I was initially motivated to put out this application because the gender-neutral language of current New International Version (2011 NIV) doesn't appeal to me as God's unadulterated word. Meanwhile the 1984 NIV I was brought up in was hardly available online. 
    <p> I added the King James Version (KJV) to support reading bible verses from the balanced perspective of two translations. And in hindsight that addition has been very beneficial. Certain crucial verses in the New Testament have superior translation in KJV to NIV (e.g. Romans 8:6, 10:10, Philemon 1:6). I know the english is archaic, but if you can, please read the New Testament in both KJV and NIV, with the meaning in KJV having preference (unless it is not clear). The KJV strategy of "almost transliteration" is superior in my opinion to the NIV strategy of "almost paraphrasing". Just wanted to share that with you as you read the New Testament. Fortunately, the two translations reinforce each other in meaning in the great majority of verses. 
    <p> Regardless of the translation, I feel that long before you read the bible cover to cover, it may help greatly to have an overview of this most important book you hold electronically. As such I have listed below my convictions of what the Christian faith is all about. <strong>About the central role of Jesus Christ in connecting man to God.</strong> 
    <p> The Bible is God's Word, and was applicable when originally given. However not everything in this book is still applicable today. Specifically the New Testament (especially after Jesus' death) overrides any portion of the Old Testament which cannot be reconciled with it (e.g. Acts 10:13-15 override the whole of Leviticus 11; in fact, any law of God given in the Old Testament <b>and not mentioned explicitly in the New Testament, no longer applies</b> &#8212; <i>Leviticus 18, Deuteronomy 18:9-14, 22:5 are the only exceptions which still apply</i>; the crucial open-ended questions of Proverbs 30:4 and Job 14:14 are now fully answered in the New Testament). This is because God has changed the way He connects with man and wants man to connect with Him thanks to Jesus Christ. Knowing this will save you from the danger of engaging in worthless religious pursuits, and failing to connect with God. 
    <p> If you haven't already, you may want to read the New Testament first, and then use the footnotes to refer to Old Testament portions as you go along. <em>A suggested order for initial reading is: </em> 
    <ol>
      <li>Luke</li>
      <li>John</li>
      <li>Acts</li>
      <li>Galatians</li>
      <li>Ephesians</li>
      <li>Philippians</li>
      <li>Hebrews</li>
      <li>James</li>
      <li>1 Peter</li>
      <li>1 John</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Another point to note is that all the books of the Bible, except for Psalms, were originally written as one undivided book without chapter or verse divisions (even Psalms didn't have verse divisions too, just chapters, which in Psalms are actually complete self-contained hymns). Chapters and verses were inserted much later to aid in recall of memory verses. Practically this means that when reading the beginning of a chapter you may want to read the ending of the previous chapter too, to see if there is a continuation of thought. Similarly when reading the end of a chapter, you may also want to read the beginning of the next chapter to see if there is a continuation of thought. This may sometimes be very helpful, to bring up an understanding hiding in between chapter continuations.  
    <p> Lastly, the maximum effect of reading this book comes from the Holy Spirit. The words need to be "sparked" by the Spirit in order to release their spiritual life into you. <strong>Acknowledging the role of the Holy Spirit which is given as a gift by Jesus to those who come to Him to follow Him, is the concluding step in connecting with God through the Bible.</strong> 
    <p> I pray that through this book you get connected to God in a way that will give your life meaning and change it forever.  
    <h2>Christian WorldView</h2>
    There is only one God, the Creator of the universe.  
    <p> This one God has always been a Father, being the Father of His one and only Eternal Son. 
    <p> This Son is the one we now know as the man Jesus Christ, the one and only Lord of all, through whom the universe was created. 
    <p> God created man and woman in His image, and crucially gave us free will. 
    <p>  Man is spirit, soul and body; and has heart, mind and conscience. The spirit was of God in the beginning. Man was originally created a <em>living soul connected to God</em>, because he was full of the immortal life and spirit of God.   
    <p> The devil introduced sin, i.e. rebellion against Godâ€™s rule, to human beings, and we, starting with our first ancestors, unfortunately bought into it. The price of sin is very high - death in all its physical and spiritual forms. In its spiritual form, death means man lost the immortal life and spirit of God, and so became a <em>dead soul disconnected from God</em>. Sin and death are responsible for so many problems: fear, distrust, shame, sickness, demonic depression, accidents, natural disasters, crime, war, poverty, mortality (i.e. death of the body), and ultimately loss and destruction of the soul. 
    <p> The universe is at war presently between God and the devil, a war which will end in eternal happiness for God and His children, and eternal torment for the devil and his followers. 
    <p> This is where the bad news is: man is born a sinner, and hence is already in danger of sharing the fate of the devil. 
    <p> <em>God is love. This is where the good news (a.k.a. gospel) begins.</em> 
    <p> He sent His Son to take away our sins, redeem us from destruction of our souls, and reconcile us to Himself. 
    <p> Before Jesus came, God established a temporary covenant with the ancient Israelite nation based on law of Moses and priesthood of Aaron. During that time the Son of God was hidden. No man knew about his existence. 
    <p>
      <strong>
        But when the time was due (<script type="text/javascript">document.write(new Date().getFullYear());</script> years ago), the Son of God was revealed when He became the man Jesus, to replace this temporary covenant with a permanent one based on Himself, by his sacrifice of death on the cross and by his resurrection from the dead. In this new covenant, man though a sinner from birth, can be born again righteous in spirit.
      </strong>
    <p> Life under the new covenant begins with repentance &ndash; admission of one's personal sins against God in a remorseful way, that leads to a change of mindset from independence from God, from rebellion against God's right to rule &hellip; to surrender to God's rule, dependence on God, decision to quit offending God. 
    <p> Coming to Jesus Christ after repentance completes entry into His new covenant, in which God and man work hand in hand to maintain man's salvation to the end. God's part is His grace, that is, His gifts of Holy Spirit, born again spirit, righteousness, and all that the new covenant has to offer us, although we do not, and will never be in the position to deserve it. That is what God's love did for man. 
    <p> Man's part under the new covenant is his response to God's love by faith, that is, his acting and working on the gracious gifts of the new covenant in full assurance that God has indeed granted them to him, although he does not deserve it, and although he does not always perceive it or feel it with his 5 senses.  
    <p> In the new covenant, Jesus is Lord. He is the only mediator between God and man. He replaced all the Old Covenant laws with His one and only new law: that we love one another as He (Jesus) loved us.
    <p> Practical living under the new covenant involves the sparking of the Word of God (through the perspective of the New Testament) in my life through the imagination. And that imagination is the expression of faith in my new relationship with God through Christ, and my new identity in Christ.
    <h3>The Fundamental Imagination of Christianity</h3>
    <blockquote> If any in Christ<br>= new creature - 2 Corinthians 5:16-17, Galatians 6:15<br>= born again spirit - John 3:3-8 </blockquote>
    <strong>I have to believe that when one is in Christ, he really is born again as a new man (2 Corinthians 4:16, Ephesians 3:16, 4:24, Colossians 3:10, 1 Peter 3:4) in spirit by the Holy Spirit. The source of information on what that man is and looks like is not the perception and feelings of the 5 senses, but rather the New Testament writings and my imagination of it inspired by the Holy Spirit. And finding that out and living it out is the adventure of Christianity. It is an experiment, in which I am the "subject under test" (Philemon 1:6).</strong> 
    <p> This is the key to understanding the New Testament. Without it, the New Testament understanding and promises largely remain outside my reach. But with this imagination, which is a spiritual reality if believed, the new covenant promises become a reality in my life. 
    <p> The parts of man renovated immediately by the new covenant, a renovation which is the great promise of the old covenant (most clearly stated in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and Ezekiel 36:25-27) are: spirit, heart, and conscience. The body will be renovated later when Jesus ressurects it to an immortal state. However the New Testament writings show that the soul is tied to free will, and so man's part in his salvation is saving his soul through faith in God's grace of changing and empowering him to live for Him. 
    <p> Christian living then becomes a battle in my mind between holding on to the old man and his ways; or acting as the new man I am in Christ by faith, regardless of my past, my environment, or people's opinions. The outcome of this battle determines the fate of my soul after the death of my body.
