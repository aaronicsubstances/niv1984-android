<div id='commentary' class='comments_sections w3-hide commentary'><p>The cure at the pool of Bethesda. (1-9) The Jews' displeasure. (10-16) Christ reproves the Jews. (17-23) Christ's discourse. (24-47)1-9 We are all by nature impotent folk in spiritual things, blind, halt, and withered; but full provision is made for our cure, if we attend to it. An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.<br /><br />10-16 Those eased of the punishment of sin, are in danger of returning to sin, when the terror and restraint are over, unless Divine grace dries up the fountain. The misery believers are made whole from, warns us to sin no more, having felt the smart of sin. This is the voice of every providence, Go, and sin no more. Christ saw it necessary to give this caution; for it is common for people, when sick, to promise much; when newly recovered, to perform only something; but after awhile to forget all. Christ spoke of the wrath to come, which is beyond compare worse than the many hours, nay, weeks and years of pain, some wicked men have to suffer in consequence of their unlawful indulgences. And if such afflictions are severe, how dreadful will be the everlasting punishment of the wicked!<br /><br />17-23 The Divine power of the miracle proved Jesus to be the Son of God, and he declared that he worked with, and like unto his Father, as he saw good. These ancient enemies of Christ understood him, and became more violent, charging him not only with sabbath-breaking, but blasphemy, in calling God his own Father, and making himself equal with God. But all things now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son, purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father; and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may think or pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.<br /><br />24-29 Our Lord declared his authority and character, as the Messiah. The time was come when the dead should hear his voice, as the Son of God, and live. Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin, to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raising the dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only be exercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May we believe His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and we shall not come into condemnation. And may His voice reach the hearts of those dead in sin; that they may do works meet for repentance, and prepare for the solemn day.<br /><br />30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.<br /><br />39-44 The Jews considered that eternal life was revealed to them in their Scriptures, and that they had it, because they had the word of God in their hands. Jesus urged them to search those Scriptures with more diligence and attention. "Ye do search the Scriptures," and ye do well to do so. They did indeed search the Scriptures, but it was with a view to their own glory. It is possible for men to be very studious in the letter of the Scriptures, yet to be strangers to its power. Or, "Search the Scriptures," and so it was spoken to them in the nature of an appeal. Ye profess to receive and believe the Scripture, let that be the judge. It is spoken to us as advising or commanding all Christians to search the Scriptures. Not only read them, and hear them, but search them; which denotes diligence in examining and studying them. We must search the Scriptures for heaven as our great end; For in them ye think ye have eternal life. We must search the Scriptures for Christ, as the new and living Way, that leads to this end. To this testimony Christ adds reproofs of their unbelief and wickedness; their neglect of him and his doctrine. Also he reproves their want of the love of God. But there is life with Jesus Christ for poor souls. Many who make a great profession of religion, yet show they want the love of God, by their neglect of Christ and contempt of his commandments. It is the love of God in us, the love that is a living, active principle in the heart, which God will accept. They slighted and undervalued Christ, because they admired and overvalued themselves. How can those believe, who make the praise and applause of men their idol! When Christ and his followers are men wondered at, how can those believe, the utmost of whose ambition is to make a fair show in the flesh!<br /><br />45-47 Many trust in some form of doctrines or some parties, who no more enter into the real meaning of those doctrines, or the views of the persons whose names they bear, than the Jews did into those of Moses. Let us search and pray over the Scriptures, as intent on finding eternal life; let us observe how Christ is the great subject of them, and daily apply to him for the life he bestows.<br /><br />Commentary by Matthew Henry, 1710.</p> </div>

Why is when the rapture / resurrection a hotly contested thing? It was not even debated until 200 years ago.<br />
<br />
Jesus tells us plainly in Matthew 13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:<br />
<br />
25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed (weeds) tares among the wheat, and went his way.<br />
<br />
26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.<br />
<br />
27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?<br />
<br />
28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?<br />
<br />
29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.<br />
<br />
30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. (first the tares WEEDS get gathered, the wheat last) could it be any more plain than this? <br />
<br />
Matthew 13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.<br />
<br />
37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;<br />
<br />
38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;<br />
<br />
39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.<br />
<br />
40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. </div>

The tares are Israel who DID NOT believe that Jesus was The Christ (Messiah) of God. <br />
<br />
The wheat are Israel who DID believe that Jesus was The Christ (Messiah) of God.<br />
<br />
At the harvest of the world, at the end of the Tribulation, angels are the reapers, tares are gathered and burned, wheat are left.<br />
<br />
The Rapture is a Mystery revealed to Paul for the Body Of Christ, both Jews and Gentiles, who believe in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, by grace through faith.<br />

Now hear the truth!<br />
<br />
He came in his fathers name, literally!<br />
<br />
His Fathers name is Yahuah. <br />
<br />
And his name is like his fathers, Yahusha. <br />
<br />
Yahu, meaning the Father. <br />
<br />
Sha, means saves. <br />
<br />
Put them together and Yahusha means Yahuah saves or Yahuah&#39;s Salvation. <br />
<br />
Jesus means absolutely nothing!<br />
<br />
Acts 4:10-12 <br />
<br />
10then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the NAME of Yahusha <br />
<br />
of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom Yahuah raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. <br />
<br />
11Yahusha is the stone you builders rejected,which has become the cornerstone.&#39;<br />
<br />
12Salvation is found in no one else, for there is NO OTHER NAME under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."<br />
<br />
The letter J was only invented 400 years ago making it impossible for the English name Jesus to be the Hebrew name of the Messiah. <br />
<br />
Christian Bibles use the false name Jesus Christ. <br />

Hi Kevin, Jesus is the name in English since we speak English and the KJV is an English Bible.<br />
<br />
One could argue that the word &#39;Yahusha&#39; is actually false, because you&#39;re attempting to use an incompletely translated name using English characters. If you spoke Hebrew you would speak and write that word differently, and not just any Hebrew, but it would have to be old, ancient Hebrew. Also, since the New Testament is in Greek, to be precise you would need to learn the exact Greek dialect at the time of Jesus in order to pronounce and write Jesus&#39;s name properly. Otherwise it&#39;s &#39;false teaching&#39;? The point is that it&#39;s normal for each language to have the words translated. It would be a logical fallacy to assume that because J in English wasn&#39;t made until later that the city of Jerusalem doesn&#39;t exist, for example, or that it&#39;s not called Jerusalem. Should we be upset that the United States of America is also translated into each language too, like in Hebrew- so are they lying by calling us that in their own language? Just challenging the assumptions about language. Jesus is the name in English. </div>

So since the letter J is a recent thing and that the name Jesus could not exist. I suppose NO J in Jesus means that <br />
<br />
JJJJ Jews do not exist either?<br />
<br />
these Yeshua group are basically DENYING the King James Bible. <br />
<br />
Matthew 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.<br />
<br />
Matthew 1:25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.<br />
<br />
The angel Gabriel told Mary to name him Jesus, not Yeshu which is a curse Jews say may his name be blotted out from under heaven. <br />
<br />
Luke 1: 26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<br />
<br />
27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&#39;s name was Mary.<br />
<br />
28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.<br />
<br />
29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<br />
<br />
30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.<br />
<br />
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<br />
<br />
32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:<br />
<br />
33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.<br />
<br />
So do we believe the Bible or Jewish fables that the New Testament Bible was originally Hebrew and mistranslated by those pagan anti-Semitic Greeks? <br />
<br />
Titus 1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. </div>

Yes I agree the name Jew never existed until at least 400 years ago. <br />
<br />
Just like Yahuah, who name his son, with his own name Yahusha, he also name his chosen people after himself, they are called Yahudim. <br />
<br />
Yahuah also name the land where they lived after his own name Yahudah. Not Judah. <br />
<br />
Matthew is also wrong, as Yahuah also name him with his own name within his correct name - Mattithyahu.<br />
<br />
You are only reading the name Jesus because that&#39;s what Christian Bible all say.<br />
<br />
No the New Testament was not written in Greek it was translated from Hebrew into Greek and it was this translation where they CHANGED Yahusha to IESOUS then more recently changed IESOUS to Jesus. <br />
<br />
Yeshua is also incorrect, so no I am not of "this Yeshua group" as you put it. <br />
<br />
You have taken Titus 1:14 out of context so I want bother with that. <br />
<br />
Do you really think that your Jesus really spoke to the Hebrews in Greek? REALY!<br />
<br />
Anyway Yahuah only loves those who call upon his name and the name of his son Yahusha. <br />
<br />
Prov 8:17 I love those who love me. </div>

Is Yeshua really Lucifer? <br />
<br />
The Complete Jewish Bible by "messianic believer" Doctor David Stern writes:<br />
<br />
Presenting the Word of God as a unified Jewish book, the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) is a translation for Jews and non-Jews alike. It connects readers with the Jewishness of the Messiah. Names and key terms are returned to their original Hebrew and presented in easy-to-understand transliterations. <br />
<br />
The CJB is a translation of the Bible into English by Dr. David H. Stern. It consists of Dr. Stern&#39;s revised translation of the Old Testament (Tanakh) plus his original Jewish New Testament (B&#39;rit Hadashah) translation in one volume. <br />
<br />
In Isaiah 14 (REMOVED LUCIFER AND INSERTS MORNING STAR) Their argument is Lucifer is a "Latin" word that does not belong in English. About 20% of English comes from Latin. Does Taco not belong in English since it is Spanish? <br />
<br />
Satanists and Luciferians know who Lucifer is. Read Carefully<br />
<br />
Isaiah 14: (the fall of Lucifer)<br />
<br />
11 Your pride has been brought down to Sh&#39;ol (Hell)<br />
<br />
with the music of your lyres,<br />
<br />
under you a mattress of maggots,<br />
<br />
over you a blanket of worms.&#39;<br />
<br />
(KJV uses Lucifer Stern inserts MORNING STAR who FELL from Heaven) <br />
<br />
12 "How did you come to fall from the heavens, <br />
<br />
MORNING STAR, son of the dawn?<br />
<br />
How did you come to be cut to the ground,<br />
<br />
conqueror of nations?<br />
<br />
13 You thought to yourself, &#39;I will scale the heavens,<br />
<br />
I will raise my throne above God&#39;s stars.<br />
<br />
I will sit on the Mount of Assembly<br />
<br />
far away in the north.<br />
<br />
14 I will rise past the tops of the clouds,<br />
<br />
I will make myself like the Most High.&#39;<br />
<br />
So who fell from heaven going to the pit of Hell? THE MORNING STAR.<br />
<br />
Who is the Morning Star? Stern says Jesus is Yeshua<br />
<br />
Revelation 22: 16 "I, (Jesus) Yeshua, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the Messianic communities. I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright MORNING STAR.<br />
<br />
Did you catch it Jesus is Yeshua the MORNING STAR in Rev 22 and in Isaiah 14 Yeshua fell from heaven making him Lucifer essentially </div>

Q: Did Jesus take the Kingdom of God from the Jews?<br />
<br />
A: Mathew 21:43 Therefore say I (Jesus speaks to Jews) unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <br />
<br />
(Lets see was it the Jews who killed Jesus and Christians? The Greeks who spread the orthodox christian faith all over eastern Europe.) <br />
<br />
Paul in 1 Thessalonians 2:14 - 16 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, EVEN AS THEY HAVE OF THE JEWS: WHO BOTH KILLED THE LORD JESUS, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and THEY PLEASE NOT GOD, and are contrary to all men: Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: FOR THE WRATH IS COME UPON THEM TO THE UTTERMOST. <br />
<br />
King James Bible book of John 5:16 - And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. <br />
<br />
John 5:18 - Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. <br />
<br />
1 Corinthians 16:22 - If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema (CURSED) Maranatha. <br />
<br />
DO JEWS LOVE JESUS OR ARE THEY CURSED? <br />
<br />
In Mark 15: 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br />
<br />
35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.<br />
<br />
these Jews did not even understand what Jesus was saying in Hebrew <br />
<br />
John 19:13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. so why would this tell you in the Hebrew Gabbatha if it was originally in Hebrew? NO it was in Greek, it was Jews who killed Christians </div>

God has NOT cast away His people Israel!<br />
<br />
Romans 11:1<br />
<br />
I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin.<br />
<br />
Israel stumbled at the cross, and fell at the stoning of Stephen.<br />
<br />
BUT through their (Israel&#39;s) fall, salvation came to the Gentiles through the apostle Paul and the gospel, believing in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, all by grace through faith.<br />
