      <content>Let us take care for fear that their numbers may become even greater, and if there is a war, they may be joined with those who are against us, and make an attack on us, and go up out of the land.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>So they put overseers of forced work over them, in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work. And they made store-towns for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.</content>

      <content>And the king of Egypt sent for the women, and said to them, Why have you done this, and let the male children go on living?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And they said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are strong, and the birth takes place before we come to them.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And when she was no longer able to keep him secret, she made him a basket out of the stems of water-plants, pasting sticky earth over it to keep the water out; and placing the baby in it she put it among the plants by the edge of the Nile.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And his sister took her place at a distance to see what would become of him.</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>And opening it, she saw the child, and he was crying. And she had pity on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</content>

      <content>And when the child was older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son, and she gave him the name Moses, Because, she said, I took him out of the water.</content>

      <content>Now when Moses had become a man, one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was; and he saw an Egyptian giving blows to a Hebrew, one of his people.</content>

      <content>And turning this way and that, and seeing no one, he put the Egyptian to death, covering his body with sand.</content>

      <content>And he said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? are you going to put me to death as you did the Egyptian? And Moses was in fear, and said, It is clear that the thing has come to light.</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>Now when Pharaoh had news of this, he would have put Moses to death. But Moses went in flight from Pharaoh into the land of Midian: and he took his seat by a water-spring.</content>

      <content>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came to get water for their father's flock.</content>

      <content>And Moses did this; as the Lord gave him orders, so he did.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>So on the first day of the first month in the second year the House was put up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Moses put up the House; placing its bases in position and lifting up its uprights, putting in the rods and planting the pillars in their places;</content>

      <content>Stretching the outer tent over it, and covering it, as the Lord had given him orders.</content>

      <content>And he put the bread on it in order before the Lord, as the Lord had said.</content>

      <content>The support for the lights he put in the Tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side:</content>

      <content>Lighting the lights before the Lord, as the Lord had given him orders.</content>

      <content>Burning sweet perfumes on it, as the Lord had given him orders.</content>

      <content>And he put up the curtain at the doorway of the House.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And at the door of the House of the Tent of meeting, he put the altar of burned offerings, offering on it the burned offering and the meal offering, as the Lord had given him orders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And between the altar and the Tent of meeting he put the vessel with water in it for washing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>In it the hands and feet of Moses and Aaron and his sons were washed,</content>

      <content>Whenever they went into the Tent of meeting, and when they came near the altar, as the Lord had given orders to Moses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And he put up the hangings forming the open space round the House and the altar, and put the curtain over the doorway. So Moses made the work complete.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Then the cloud came down covering the Tent of meeting, and the House was full of the glory of the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>So that Moses was not able to go into the Tent of meeting, because the cloud was resting on it, and the House was full of the glory of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And whenever the cloud was taken up from the House, the children of Israel went forward on their journey:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>But while the cloud was there, they made no move till it was taken up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>For the cloud of the Lord was resting on the House by day, and at night there was fire in the cloud, before the eyes of all the people of Israel, and so it was through all their journeys.</content>
