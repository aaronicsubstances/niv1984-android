    <verse num="1">
      <content>The history of Nehemiah, the son of Hacaliah. Now it came about, in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, when I was in Shushan, the king's town,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>That Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah; and in answer to my request for news of the Jews who had been prisoners and had got away, and of Jerusalem,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>They said to me, The small band of Jews now living there in the land are in great trouble and shame: the wall of Jerusalem has been broken down, and its doorways burned with fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then, after hearing these words, for some days I gave myself up to weeping and sorrow, seated on the earth; and taking no food I made prayer to the God of heaven,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And said, O Lord, the God of heaven, the great God, greatly to be feared, keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open, so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant, which I make before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel, your servants, while I put before you the sins of the children of Israel, which we have done against you: truly, I and my father's people are sinners.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>We have done great wrong against you, and have not kept the orders, the rules, and the decisions, which you gave to your servant Moses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Keep in mind, O Lord, the order you gave your servant Moses, saying, If you do wrong I will send you wandering among the peoples:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But if you come back to me and keep my orders and do them, even if those of you who have been forced out are living in the farthest parts of heaven, I will get them from there, and take them back to the place marked out by me for the resting-place of my name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>O Lord, let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant, and of the prayers of your servants, who take delight in worshipping your name: give help, O Lord, to your servant this day, and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man. (Now I was the king's wine-servant.)</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never before been sad when the king was present.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the king said to me, Why is your face sad, seeing that you are not ill? this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was full of fear;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And said to the king, May the king be living for ever: is it not natural for my face to be sad, when the town, the place where the bodies of my fathers are at rest, has been made waste and its doorways burned with fire?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then the king said to me, What is your desire? So I made prayer to the God of heaven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And I said to the king, If it is the king's pleasure, and if your servant has your approval, send me to Judah, to the town where the bodies of my fathers are at rest, so that I may take in hand the building of it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the king said to me (the queen being seated by his side), How long will your journey take, and when will you come back? So the king was pleased to send me, and I gave him a fixed time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Further, I said to the king, If it is the king's pleasure, let letters be given to me for the rulers across the river, so that they may let me go through till I come to Judah;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's park, so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of the tower of the house, and for the wall of the town, and for the house which is to be mine. And the king gave me this, for the hand of my God was on me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Then I came to the rulers of the lands across the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, hearing of it, were greatly troubled because a man had come to the help of the children of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And in the night I got up, taking with me a small band of men; I said nothing to any man of what God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem: and I had no beast with me but the one on which I was seated.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And I went out by night, through the doorway of the valley, and past the dragon's water-spring as far as the place where waste material was put, viewing the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and the doorways which had been burned with fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Then I went on to the door of the fountain and to the king's pool: but there was no room for my beast to get through.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Then in the night, I went up by the stream, viewing the wall; then turning back, I went in by the door in the valley, and so came back.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the chiefs had no knowledge of where I had been or what I was doing; and I had not then said anything to the Jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of those who were doing the work.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then I said to them, You see what a bad condition we are in; how Jerusalem is a waste, and its doorways burned with fire: come, let us get to work, building up the wall of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer be put to shame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then I gave them an account of how the hand of my God was on me, helping me; and of the king's words which he had said to me. And they said, Let us get to work on the building. So they made their hands strong for the good work.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, hearing of it, made sport of us, laughing at us and saying, What are you doing? will you go against the king?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Then answering them I said, The God of heaven, he will be our help; so we his servants will go on with our building: but you have no part or right or any name in Jerusalem.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now, Sanballat, hearing that we were building the wall, was very angry, and in his wrath made sport of the Jews.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And in the hearing of his countrymen and the army of Samaria he said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they make themselves strong? will they make offerings? will they get the work done in a day? will they make the stones which have been burned come again out of the dust?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Such is their building that if a fox goes up it, their stone wall will be broken down.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Give ear, O our God, for we are looked down on: let their words of shame be turned back on themselves, and let them be given up to wasting in a land where they are prisoners:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Let not their wrongdoing be covered or their sin washed away from before you: for they have made you angry before the builders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>So we went on building the wall; and all the wall was joined together half-way up: for the people were working hard.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But when it came to the ears of Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites, that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the broken places were being made good, they were full of wrath;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And they made designs, all of them together, to come and make an attack on Jerusalem, causing trouble there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But we made our prayer to God, and had men on watch against them day and night because of them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Judah said, The strength of the workmen is giving way, and there is much waste material; it is impossible for us to put up the wall.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And those who were against us said, Without their knowledge and without their seeing us, we will come among them and put them to death, causing the work to come to a stop.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And it came about that when the Jews who were living near them came, they said to us ten times, From all directions they are coming against us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>So in the lowest part of the space at the back of the walls, in the open places, I put the people by families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And after looking, I got up and said to the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people, Have no fear of them: keep in mind the Lord who is great and greatly to be feared, and take up arms for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives and your houses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And when it came to the ears of those who were against us, that we had knowledge of their designs and that God had made their purpose come to nothing, we all went back to the wall, everyone to his work</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And from that time, half of my servants were doing their part of the work, and half kept the spears and body-covers and the bows and the metal war-dresses; and the chiefs were at the back of the men of Judah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part, everyone working with one hand, with his spear in the other;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Every builder was working with his sword at his side. And by my side was a man for sounding the horn.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And I said to the great ones and the chiefs and the rest of the people, The work is great and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Wherever you may be when the horn is sounded, come here to us; our God will be fighting for us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>So we went on with the work: and half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And at the same time I said to the people, Let everyone with his servant come inside Jerusalem for the night, so that at night they may keep watch for us, and go on working by day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>So not one of us, I or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me, took off his clothing, everyone went armed to the water.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the Jews.</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>For there were some who said, We, our sons and our daughters, are a great number: let us get grain, so that we may have food for our needs.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And there were some who said, We are giving our fields and our vine-gardens and our houses for debt: let us get grain because we are in need.</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>And there were others who said, We have given up our fields and our vine-gardens to get money for the king's taxes.</content>

      <content>But our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen, and our children as their children: and now we are giving our sons and daughters into the hands of others, to be their servants, and some of our daughters are servants even now: and we have no power to put a stop to it; for other men have our fields and our vine-gardens.</content>

      <content>And on hearing their outcry and what they said I was very angry.</content>

      <content>And after turning it over in my mind, I made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers, and said to them, Every one of you is taking interest from his countryman. And I got together a great meeting of protest.</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>And I said to them, We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they said nothing, answering not a word.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And I said, What you are doing is not good: is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our God, because of the shame which the nations may put on us?</content>

      <content>Even I and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have. So now, let us give up this thing.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>Give back to them this very day their fields, their vine-gardens, their olive-gardens, and their houses, as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Then they said, We will give them back, and take nothing for them; we will do as you say. Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And shaking out the folds of my robe, I said, So may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement; even so let him be sent out and made as nothing.

      <content>Now from the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year till the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep, and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver; and even their servants were lords over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And I kept on with the work of this wall, and we got no land for ourselves: and all my servants were helping with the work.</content>

      <content>Now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep, as well as fowls; and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine: but all the same, I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right, because the people were crushed under a hard yoke.</content>

      <content>And by the doorway of the fountain and straight in front of them, they went up by the steps of the town of David, at the slope up of the wall, over the house of David, as far as the water-doorway to the east.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And the other band of those who gave praise went to the left, and I went after them with half the people, on the wall, over the tower of the ovens, as far as the wide wall;</content>

    <verse num="39">
      <content>And over the doorway of Ephraim and by the old door and the fish door and the tower of Hananel and the tower of Hammeah, as far as the sheep door: and at the doorway of the watchmen they came to a stop.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>So the two bands of those who gave praise took up their positions in the house of God, and I and half of the chiefs with me:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with wind instruments;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer. And the makers of melody made their voices loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And on that day they made great offerings and were glad; for God had made them glad with great joy; and the women and the children were glad with them: so that the joy of Jerusalem came to the ears of those who were far off.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>And on that day certain men were put over the rooms where the things which had been given were stored, for the lifted offerings and the first-fruits and the tenths, and to take into them the amounts, from the fields of every town, fixed by the law for the priests and the Levites: for Judah was glad on account of the priests and the Levites who were in their places.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>And they kept the watch of their God, and were responsible for making things clean, and so did the music-makers and the door-keepers, as it was ordered by David and Solomon his son.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>For in the days of David and Asaph in the past, there was a master of the music, and songs of blessing and praise to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave what was needed by the music-makers and the door-keepers day by day: and they made the offerings holy for the Levites; and the Levites did the same for the sons of Aaron.</content>

  <chapter num="13" preferred_title="Nehemiah">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>On that day there was a reading from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and they saw that it said in the book that no Ammonite or Moabite might ever come into the meeting of God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Because they did not give the children of Israel bread and water when they came to them, but got Balaam to put a curse on them: though the curse was turned into a blessing by our God.</content>

      <content>So after hearing the law, they took out of Israel all the mixed people.</content>

      <content>Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who had been placed over the rooms of the house of our God, being a friend of Tobiah,</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>Had made ready for him a great room, where at one time they kept the meal offerings, the perfume, and the vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil which were given by order to the Levites and the music-makers and the door-keepers, and the lifted offerings for the priests.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went to the king; and after some days, I got the king to let me go,</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>And I came to Jerusalem; and it was clear to me what evil Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in making ready for him a room in the buildings of the house of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And it was evil in my eyes: so I had all Tobiah's things put out of the room.</content>

      <content>Then I gave orders, and they made the rooms clean: and I put back in them the vessels of the house of God, with the meal offerings and the perfume.</content>

      <content>And I saw that the Levites had not been given what was needed for their support; so that the Levites and the music-makers, who did the work, had gone away, everyone to his field.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then I made protests to the chiefs, and said, Why has the house of God been given up? And I got them together and put them in their places.</content>

      <content>Then all Judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the store-houses.</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>And I made controllers over the store-houses, Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and with them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah: they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers.</content>

      <content>In those days, I saw in Judah some who were crushing grapes on the Sabbath, and getting in grain and putting it on asses; as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods which they took into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And there were men of Tyre there, who came with fish and all sorts of goods, trading with the children of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then I made protests to the chiefs of Judah, and said to them, What is this evil which you are doing, not keeping the Sabbath day holy?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Did not your fathers do the same, and did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town? but you are causing more wrath to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And so, when the streets of Jerusalem were getting dark before the Sabbath, I gave orders for the doors to be shut and not to be open again till after the Sabbath: and I put some of my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>So the traders in all sorts of goods took their night's rest outside Jerusalem once or twice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Then I gave witness against them and said, Why are you waiting all night by the wall? if you do so again I will have you taken prisoners. From that time they did not come again on the Sabbath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And I gave the Levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the Sabbath holy. Keep this in mind to my credit, O my God, and have mercy on me, for great is your mercy.</content>

    <verse num="23">
      <content>And in those days I saw the Jews who were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod; they had no knowledge of the Jews' language, but made use of the language of the two peoples.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And I took up the cause against them, cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair; and I made them take an oath by God, saying, You are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</content>

    <verse num="26">
      <content>Was it not in these things that Solomon, king of Israel, did wrong? among a number of nations there was no king like him, and he was dear to his God, and God made him king over all Israel: but even he was made to do evil by strange women.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil, sinning against our God by taking strange women for your wives?</content>

      <content>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the chief priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: so I sent him away from me.</content>

      <content>So I made them clean from all strange people, and had regular watches fixed for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;</content>
