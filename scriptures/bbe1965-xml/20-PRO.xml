    <verse num="1">
      <content>The wise sayings of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>To have knowledge of wise teaching; to be clear about the words of reason:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>To be trained in the ways of wisdom, in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>To make the simple-minded sharp, and to give the young man knowledge, and serious purpose:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>(The wise man, hearing, will get greater learning, and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided:)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>To get the sense of wise sayings and secrets, and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>The fear of the Lord is the start of knowledge: but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>My son, give ear to the training of your father, and do not give up the teaching of your mother:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For they will be a crown of grace for your head, and chain-ornaments about your neck.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>My son, if sinners would take you out of the right way, do not go with them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>If they say, Come with us; let us make designs against the good, waiting secretly for the upright, without cause;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Let us overcome them living, like the underworld, and in their strength, as those who go down to death;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Goods of great price will be ours, our houses will be full of wealth;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Take your chance with us, and we will all have one money-bag:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>My son, do not go with them; keep your feet from their ways:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For their feet are running after evil, and they are quick to take a man's life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Truly, to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit; it takes away the life of its owners.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Her words are sounding in the meeting-places, and in the doorways of the town:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>How long, you simple ones, will foolish things be dear to you? and pride a delight to the haters of authority? how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind;</content>

      <content>So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge;</content>

      <content>Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge;</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth;</content>

      <content>Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours.</content>

      <content>For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason:</content>

      <content>He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him.</content>

      <content>Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way.</content>

      <content>For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul;</content>

      <content>Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you;</content>

      <content>Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false;</content>

      <content>Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads;</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades:</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life:</content>
