    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Give ear to this, you old men, and take note, you people of the land. Has this ever been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Give the story of it to your children, and let them give it to their children, and their children to another generation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>What the worm did not make a meal of, has been taken by the locust; and what the locust did not take, has been food for the plant-worm; and what the plant-worm did not take, has been food for the field-fly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Come out of your sleep, you who are overcome with wine, and give yourselves to weeping; give cries of sorrow, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it has been cut off from your mouths.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For a nation has come up over my land, strong and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the back teeth of a great lion.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>By him my vine is made waste and my fig-tree broken: he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth; its branches are made white.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>The meal offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's servants, are sorrowing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">

    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>The farmers are shamed, the workers in the vine-gardens give cries of grief, for the wheat and the barley; for the produce of the fields has come to destruction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>The vine has become dry and the fig-tree is feeble; the pomegranate and the palm-tree and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are dry: because joy has gone from the sons of men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow, you priests; give cries of grief, you servants of the altar: come in, and, clothed in haircloth, let the night go past, you servants of my God: for the meal offering and the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">

    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>The grains have become small and dry under the spade; the store-houses are made waste, the grain-stores are broken down; for the grain is dry and dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>What sounds of pain come from the beasts! the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them; even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>O Lord, my cry goes up to you: for fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste, and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>The beasts of the field are turning to you with desire: for the water-streams are dry and fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Let the horn be sounded in Zion, and a war-cry in my holy mountain; let all the people of the land be troubled: for the day of the Lord is coming;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For a day of dark and deep shade is near, a day of cloud and black night: like a black cloud a great and strong people is covering the mountains; there has never been any like them and will not be after them again, from generation to generation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Before them fire sends destruction, and after them flame is burning: the land is like the garden of Eden before them, and after them an unpeopled waste; truly, nothing has been kept safe from them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Their form is like the form of horses, and they are running like war-horses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Like the sound of war-carriages they go jumping on the tops of the mountains; like the noise of a flame of fire burning up the grain-stems, like a strong people lined up for the fight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>At their coming the people are bent with pain: all faces become red together.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>They are running like strong men, they go over the wall like men of war; every man goes straight on his way, their lines are not broken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>No one is pushing against another; everyone goes straight on his way: bursting through the sword points, their order is not broken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>They make a rush on the town, running on the wall; they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a thief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>The earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking: the sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the Lord is thundering before his forces; for very great is his army; for he is strong who gives effect to his word: for the day of the Lord is great and greatly to be feared, and who has strength against it?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>But even now, says the Lord, come back to me with all your heart, keeping from food, with weeping and with sorrow:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Let your hearts be broken, and not your clothing, and come back to the Lord your God: for he is full of grace and pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, ready to be turned from his purpose of punishment.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>May it not be that he will again let his purpose be changed and let a blessing come after him, even a meal offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Let a horn be sounded in Zion, let a time be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Get the people together, make the mass of the people holy, send for the old men, get together the children and babies at the breast: let the newly married man come out of his room and the bride from her tent.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Let the priests, the servants of the Lord, be weeping between the covered way and the altar, and let them say, Have mercy on your people, O Lord, do not give up your heritage to shame, so that the nations become their rulers: why let them say among the peoples, Where is their God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then the Lord had a care for the honour of his land and had pity on his people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And the Lord made answer and said to his people, See, I will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure: and I will no longer let you be shamed among the nations:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>I will send the one from the north far away from you, driving him into a dry and waste land, with his front to the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west, and the smell of him will go up, even his evil smell will go up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Have no fear, O land; be glad with great joy; for the Lord has done great things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Have no fear, you beasts of the field, for the grass-lands of the waste are becoming green, for the trees are producing fruit, the fig-tree and the vine give out their strength.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Be glad, then, you children of Zion, and have joy in the Lord your God: for he gives you food in full measure, making the rain come down for you, the early and the late rain as at the first.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And the floors will be full of grain, and the crushing-places overflowing with wine and oil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>I will give back to you the years which were food for the locust, the plant-worm, the field-fly, and the worm, my great army which I sent among you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>You will have food in full measure, and give praise to the name of the Lord your God, who has done wonders for you:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And you will be certain that I am in Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other: and my people will never be shamed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And after that, it will come about, says the Lord, that I will send my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, your old men will have dreams, your young men will see visions:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And on the servants and the servant-girls in those days I will send my spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And I will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>The sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood, before the great day of the Lord comes, a day to be feared.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the Lord will be kept safe: for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem some will be kept safe, as the Lord has said, and will be among the small band marked out by the Lord.</content>
