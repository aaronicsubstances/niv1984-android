    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>The Lord is a God who takes care of his honour and gives punishment for wrong; the Lord gives punishment and is angry; the Lord sends punishment on those who are against him, being angry with his haters.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>The Lord is slow to get angry and great in power, and will not let the sinner go without punishment: the way of the Lord is in the wind and the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>He says sharp words to the sea and makes it dry, drying up all the rivers: Bashan is feeble, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon is without strength.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>The mountains are shaking because of him, and the hills flowing away; the earth is falling to bits before him, the world and all who are in it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Who may keep his place before his wrath? and who may undergo the heat of his passion? his wrath is let loose like fire and the rocks are broken open by him.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But like water overflowing he will take them away; he will put an end to those who come up against him, driving his haters into the dark.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>What are you designing against the Lord? he will put an end to it: his haters will not come up again a second time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For though they are like twisted thorns, and are overcome as with drink, they will come to destruction like stems of grass fully dry.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>One has gone out from you who is designing evil against the Lord, whose purposes are of no value.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>This is what the Lord has said: The days of my cause against you are ended; they are cut off and past. Though I have sent trouble on you, you will no longer be troubled.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And now I will let his yoke be broken off you, and your chains be parted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>The Lord has given an order about you, that no more of your name are to be planted: from the house of your gods I will have the pictured and metal images cut off; I will make your last resting-place a place of shame; for you are completely evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>See on the mountains the feet of him who comes with good news, giving word of peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah, give effect to your oaths: for the good-for-nothing man will never again go through you; he is completely cut off.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For the Lord will make good the vine of Jacob, as well as the vine of Israel: for the wasters have made them waste and sent destruction on the branches of their vine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>The body-covers of his fighting men have been made red, the men of war are clothed in bright red: the war-carriages are like flames of fire in the day when he gets ready, the horses are shaking.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>The war-carriages are rushing through the streets, pushing against one another in the wide ways, looking like burning lights, running like thunder-flames.</content>
    </verse>

    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>The river doorways are forced open, and the king's house is flowing away.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Everything has been taken from her, all is gone, she has nothing more: the heart is turned to water, the knees are shaking, all are twisted in pain, and colour has gone from all faces.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Where is the lions' hole, the place where the young lions got their food, where the lion and the she-lion were walking with their young, without cause for fear?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Food enough for his young and for his she-lions was pulled down by the lion; his hole was full of flesh and his resting-place stored with meat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies, and I will have your war-carriages burned in the smoke, and your young lions will be food for the sword: you will no longer get your food by force on the earth, and the voice of your she-lions will be stopped for ever.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Horsemen driving forward, and the shining sword and the bright spear: and a great number of wounded, and masses of dead bodies; they are falling over the bodies of the dead:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Because of all the false ways of the loose woman, expert in attraction and wise in secret arts, who takes nations in the net of her false ways, and families through her secret arts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies, and I will have your skirts pulled over your face, and let the nations see you unclothed, and the kingdoms your shame.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="7">

    </verse>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>But even she has been taken away, she has gone away as a prisoner: even her young children are smashed to bits at the top of all the streets: the fate of her honoured men is put to the decision of chance, and all her great men are put in chains.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>All your walled places will be like fig-trees and your people like the first figs, falling at a shake into the mouth which is open for them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>See, the people who are in you are women; the doorways of your land are wide open to your attackers: the locks of your doors have been burned away in the fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
