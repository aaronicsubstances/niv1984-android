    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And she will give birth to a son; and you will give him the name Jesus; for he will give his people salvation from their sins.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now when the birth of Jesus took place in Beth-lehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Saying, Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place? We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And when it came to the ears of Herod the king, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>You Beth-lehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the chiefs of Judah: out of you will come a ruler, who will be the keeper of my people Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Then Herod sent for the wise men privately, and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said, Go and make certain where the young child is; and when you have seen him, let me have news of it, so that I may come and give him worship.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And after hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the young child was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And when they saw the star they were full of joy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary, his mother; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship; and from their store they gave him offerings of gold, perfume, and spices.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod; so they went into their country by another way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And when they had gone, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream, saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into Egypt, and do not go from there till I give you word; for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>So he took the young child and his mother by night, and went into Egypt;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And was there till the death of Herod; so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true, Out of Egypt have I sent for my son.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was very angry; and he sent out, and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it, from two years old and under, acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted for their loss.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: because they who were attempting to take the young child's life are dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And he got up, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was in fear of going there; and God having given him news of the danger in a dream, he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth: so that the word of the prophets might come true, He will be named a Nazarene.</content>

      <content>For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said, The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight.</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him, and all the people from near Jordan;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying openly that they had done wrong.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of snakes, at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Let your change of heart be seen in your works:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And say not to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees; every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down, and put into the fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Truly, I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed; but he who comes after me is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to take up: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out.</content>

      <content>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be given baptism by him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But John would have kept him back, saying, It is I who have need of baptism from you, and do you come to me?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But Jesus made answer, saying to him, Let it be so now: because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete. Then he gave him baptism.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And Jesus, having been given baptism, straight away went up from the water; and, the heavens opening, he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove;</content>

      <content>Then the Evil One took him to the holy town; and he put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him,</content>

      <content>Jesus said to him, Again it is in the Writings, You may not put the Lord your God to the test.</content>

    <verse num="36">
      <content>Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Be seated here, while I go over there for prayer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became sad and very troubled.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And he went forward a little, and falling down on his face in prayer, he said, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup go from me; but let not my pleasure, but yours be done.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>And he comes to the disciples, and sees that they are sleeping, and says to Peter, What, were you not able to keep watch with me one hour?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test: the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>Again, a second time he went away, and said in prayer, O my Father, if this may not go from me without my taking it, let your pleasure be done.</content>

      <content>And he came again and saw them sleeping, for their eyes were tired.</content>

      <content>And he went away from them again, and a third time said the same prayer.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Then he comes to the disciples; and says to them, Go on sleeping now, and take your rest: for the hour is come, and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men.</content>

      <content>Up, let us be going: see, he who gives me up is near.</content>

    <verse num="47">
      <content>And while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a band armed with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and those in authority over the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>Now the false one had given them a sign saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he: take him.</content>

      <content>But how then would the Writings come true, which say that so it has to be?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="55">
      <content>In that hour Jesus said to the people, Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="56">
      <content>But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true. Then all his disciples went from him in flight.</content>

    <verse num="57">
      <content>And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together.</content>

      <content>Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;</content>

      <content>And the high priest got up and said to him, Have you no answer? what is it which these say against you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="63">
      <content>But Jesus said not a word. And the high priest said to him, I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will say to us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="64">
      <content>Jesus says to him, You say so: but I say to you, From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="65">
      <content>Then the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, He has said evil against God: what more need have we of witnesses? for now his words against God have come to your ears:</content>
    </verse>

      <content>What is your opinion? They made answer and said, It is right for him to be put to death.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Then they put shame on him, and were cruel to him: and some gave him blows, saying,</content>

      <content>Be a prophet, O Christ, and say who gave you a blow!</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Then Judas, who was false to him, seeing that he was to be put to death, in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority,</content>

      <content>But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death.</content>

      <content>And all the people made answer and said, Let his blood be on us, and on our children.</content>

      <content>In the same way, the chief priests, making sport of him, with the scribes and those in authority, said,</content>

      <content>Give orders, then, that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day, for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people, He has come back from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.</content>
