    <verse num="1">
      <content>From the first he was the Word, and the Word was in relation with God and was God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>This Word was from the first in relation with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>All things came into existence through him, and without him nothing was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>What came into existence in him was life, and the life was the light of men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the light goes on shining in the dark; it is not overcome by the dark.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>He came for witness, to give witness about the light, so that all men might have faith through him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>He himself was not the light: he was sent to give witness about the light.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>The true light, which gives light to every man, was then coming into the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>He was in the world, the world which came into being through him, but the world had no knowledge of him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>He came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>To all those who did so take him, however, he gave the right of becoming children of God--that is, to those who had faith in his name:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Whose birth was from God and not from blood, or from an impulse of the flesh and man's desire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And so the Word became flesh and took a place among us for a time; and we saw his glory--such glory as is given to an only son by his father--saw it to be true and full of grace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>John gave witness about him, crying, This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>From his full measure we have all been given grace on grace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For the law was given through Moses; grace and the true way of life are ours through Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>No man has seen God at any time; the only Son, who is on the breast of the Father, he has made clear what God is.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question, Who are you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>He said quite openly and straightforwardly, I am not the Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And they said to him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And his answer was, I am not.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the waste land, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And they put this question to him, saying, Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>John's answer was: I give baptism with water; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>It is he who is coming after me; I am not good enough to undo his shoes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was giving baptism.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>This is he of whom I said, One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>I myself had no knowledge of him, but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And John gave this witness, saying, I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>I had no knowledge who he was, but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting, it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>The day after, John was there again with two of his disciples;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said, See, there is the Lamb of God!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>Hearing what he said, the two disciples went after Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And Jesus, turning round, saw them coming after him and said to them, What are you looking for? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where are you living?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>He said to them, Come and see. They went with him then and saw where he was living; and they were with him all that day: it was then about the tenth hour of the day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two men who, hearing what John said, went after Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him, We have made discovery! It is the Messiah! (which is to say, the Christ).</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And he took him to Jesus. Looking at him fixedly Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; your name will be Cephas (which is to say, Peter).</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>The day after this, Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee. He came across Philip and said to him, Come and be my disciple.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>Now Philip's town was Beth-saida, where Andrew and Peter came from.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>Philip came across Nathanael and said to him, We have made a discovery! It is he of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets were writing, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>Nazareth! said Nathanael, Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, See, here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>Nathanael said to him, Where did you get knowledge of me? In answer Jesus said, Before Philip was talking with you, while you were still under the fig-tree, I saw you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>Nathanael said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>In answer Jesus said to him, You have faith because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than these.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>And he said to him, Truly I say to you all, You will see heaven opening and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of man.</content>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>On the third day two people were going to be married at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And Jesus with his disciples came as guests.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>When they had not enough wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Woman, this is not your business; my time is still to come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now six pots of stone, every one taking two or three firkins of water, were placed there for the purpose of washing, as is the way of the Jews.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Jesus said to the servants, Make the pots full of water. And they made them full to the top.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then he said to them, Now take some, and give it to the master of the feast. So they took it to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>After tasting the water which had now become wine, the master of the feast (having no idea where it came from, though it was clear to the servants who took the water out) sent for the newly-married man,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And said to him, Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good; but you have kept the good wine till now.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly; and his disciples put their faith in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they were there not more than two or three days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves, and he saw the changers of money in their seats:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And to those who were trading in doves he said, Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a market.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say, I am on fire with passion for your house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then the Jews put this question to him: What sign of authority have you to give us, seeing that you do these things?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Jesus said to them, Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>The Jews said, The building of this Temple took forty-six years; and you will put it up in three days!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But his words were about that holy building which was his body.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>So when he had come back again from the dead, the memory of these words came back to the disciples, and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, a great number of people came to have faith in his name, after seeing the signs which he did.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But Jesus did not have faith in them, because he had knowledge of them all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>He had no need for any witness about man; for he himself had knowledge of what was in man.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus, who was one of the rulers of the Jews.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>He came to Jesus by night and said to him, Rabbi, we are certain that you have come from God as a teacher, because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if God was not with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you, Without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Nicodemus said to him, How is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old? Is he able to go into his mother's body a second time and come to birth again?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Jesus said in answer, Truly, I say to you, If a man's birth is not from water and from the Spirit, it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>That which has birth from the flesh is flesh, and that which has birth from the Spirit is spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Do not be surprised that I say to you, It is necessary for you to have a second birth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>The wind goes where its pleasure takes it, and the sound of it comes to your ears, but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes: so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And Nicodemus said to him, How is it possible for these things to be?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Jesus, answering, said, Are you the teacher of Israel and have no knowledge of these things?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Truly, I say to you, We say that of which we have knowledge; we give witness of what we have seen; and you do not take our witness to be true.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth, how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>As the snake was lifted up by Moses in the waste land, even so it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>God did not send his Son into the world to be judge of the world; he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>The man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged; but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now, because he has no faith in the name of the only Son of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And this is the test by which men are judged: the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light, because their acts are evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But he whose life is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judaea, and there he was with them for some time, giving baptism.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were given baptism.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For at this time John had not been put into prison.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Then a question came up between John's disciples and a Jew about washing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And they went to John and said to him, Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the man to whom you gave witness, is now giving baptism, and everyone is going to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And this was John's answer: A man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>You yourselves give witness that I said, I am not the Christ. What I said was, I am sent before the Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>He who has the bride is the husband: but the husband's friend, whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him, is full of joy because of the husband's voice: such is my joy, and it is complete.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>He has to become greater while I become less.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>He who comes from heaven is greater than all others: he who comes from earth is of the earth, and of the earth are his words: he who comes from heaven is over all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>He gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears; and no man takes his witness as true.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>For he whom God has sent says God's words; and God does not give him the Spirit by measure.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>He who has faith in the Son has eternal life; but he who has not faith in the Son will not see life; God's wrath is resting on him.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>(Though, in fact, it was his disciples who gave baptism, not Jesus himself),</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>He went out of Judaea into Galilee again.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar, near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>A woman of Samaria came to get water, and Jesus said to her, Give me some water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For his disciples had gone to the town to get food.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>The woman of Samaria said to him, Why do you, a Jew, make a request for water to me, a woman of Samaria? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>In answer Jesus said, If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you, Give me water, you would make your prayer to him, and he would give you living water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>The woman said to him, Sir, you have no vessel and the fountain is deep; from where will you get the living water?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself, with his children and his cattle?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Go, get your husband and come back here with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>In answer, the woman said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have said rightly, I have no husband:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>You have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband: that was truly said.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>The woman said to him, Sir, I see that you are a prophet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Woman, take my word for this; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>You give worship, but without knowledge of what you are worshipping: we give worship to what we have knowledge of: for salvation comes from the Jews.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But the time is coming, and is even now here, when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit, for these are the worshippers desired by the Father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Jesus said to her, I, who am talking to you, am he.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?</content>

      <content>Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town, and said to the people,</content>

      <content>Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did! Is it possible that this is the Christ?</content>
    </verse>

      <content>So they went out of the town and came to him.</content>

      <content>While this was taking place, the disciples were saying to Jesus, Master, take some food.</content>

      <content>But he said to them, I have food of which you have no knowledge.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>So the disciples said one to another, Did anyone give him food?</content>

      <content>He who does the cutting now has his reward; he is getting together fruit for eternal life, so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>In this the saying is a true one, One does the planting, and another gets in the grain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting: other men did that work, and you take the reward.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness: He has been talking to me of everything I ever did.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time, and he was there two days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And they said to the woman, Now we have faith, but not because of your story: we ourselves have given ear to his words, and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son, who was near to death, and make him well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>Then Jesus said to him, You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>The man said, Sir, come down before my boy is dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>And Jesus said, Go in peace; your son is living. The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>And while he was going down, his servants came to him and said, Your boy is living.</content>

      <content>So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him, Your son is living. And he had faith in Jesus, he and all his family.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha. It has five doorways.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases: some unable to see, some without the power of walking, some with wasted bodies.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition, and so he said to the man, Is it your desire to get well?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>The ill man said in answer, Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Jesus said to him, Get up, take your bed and go.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And the man became well straight away, and took up his bed and went. Now that day was the Sabbath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>So the Jews said to the man who had been made well, It is the Sabbath; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>He said to them, But he who made me well, said to me, Take up your bed and go.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Then they put to him the question: Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and go?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was, Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him, See, you are well and strong; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But his answer was: My Father is still working even now, and so I am working.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>So Jesus made answer and said, Truly I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything himself; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does: and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder.</content>

      <content>In the same way, as the Father gives life to the dead, even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it.</content>

      <content>The Father is not the judge of men, but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son;</content>

      <content>Truly I say to you, The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me, has eternal life; he will not be judged, but has come from death into life.</content>

      <content>Of myself I am unable to do anything: as the voice comes to me so I give a decision: and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself, but only what is pleasing to him who sent me.</content>

      <content>And when they had had enough, Jesus said to his disciples, Take up the broken bits which are over, so that nothing may be wasted.</content>

      <content>And having said this, she went away and said secretly to her sister Mary, The Master is here and has sent for you.</content>

      <content>Now Jesus had not at this time come into the town, but was still in the place where Martha had seen him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, when they saw Mary get up quickly and go out, went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there.</content>

    <verse num="32">
      <content>When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she went down at his feet, saying, Lord, if you had been here my brother would not be dead.</content>

      <content>And when Jesus saw her weeping, and saw the Jews weeping who came with her, his spirit was moved and he was troubled,</content>

    <verse num="34">
      <content>And said, Where have you put him? They said, Come and see, Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And Jesus himself was weeping.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>So the Jews said, See how dear he was to him!</content>

      <content>But some of them said, This man, who made open the eyes of the blind man, was he not able to keep his friend from death?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>So Jesus, deeply troubled in heart, came to the place of the dead. It was a hole in the rock, and a stone was over the opening.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said, Lord, by this time the body will be smelling, for he has been dead four days.</content>

      <content>Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of God?</content>

    <verse num="41">
      <content>So they took away the stone. And Jesus, looking up to heaven, said, Father, I give praise to you for hearing me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me, but I said it because of these who are here, so that they may see that you sent me.</content>

      <content>Then he said in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!</content>

    <verse num="44">
      <content>And he who was dead came out, with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet, and a cloth about his face. Jesus said to them, Make him free and let him go.</content>

      <content>Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him.</content>

      <content>Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said, What are we doing? This man is doing a number of signs.</content>

    <verse num="49">
      <content>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You have no knowledge of anything;</content>

    <verse num="50">
      <content>You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people, so that all the nation may not come to destruction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>He did not say this of himself, but being the high priest that year he said, as a prophet, that Jesus would be put to death for the nation;</content>

      <content>And not for that nation only, but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world.</content>

    <verse num="53">
      <content>And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="54">
      <content>So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near to the waste land, to a town named Ephraim, where he was for some time with the disciples.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="55">
      <content>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had made to come back from the dead.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Then Mary, taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value, put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair: and the house became full of the smell of the perfume.</content>

      <content>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to give him up), said,</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death;</content>

      <content>They took him first to Annas, because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year.</content>

      <content>It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people.</content>

      <content>Then the girl who was the door-keeper said to Peter, Are you not one of this man's disciples? In answer he said, I am not.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them, warming himself.</content>

      <content>Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Jesus made answer, I said things openly to the world at all times; I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come; and I have said nothing secretly.</content>

    <verse num="21">
      <content>Why are you questioning me? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them: they have knowledge of what I said.</content>

      <content>Jesus said in answer, If I have said anything evil, give witness to the evil: but if I said what is true, why do you give me blows?</content>

      <content>Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas, the high priest.</content>

      <content>One of the servants of the high priest, a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter, said, Did I not see you with him in the garden?</content>

      <content>Then again Peter said, No. And straight away a cock gave its cry.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not go into the Praetorium, so that they might not become unclean, but might take the Passover.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>So Pilate came out to them and put the question: What have you to say against this man?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>They said to him in answer, If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.</content>

    <verse num="32">
      <content>(That the word of Jesus might come true, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Jesus made answer, Do you say this of yourself, or did others say it about me?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>Pilate said, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands: what have you done?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>Jesus said in answer, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom was of this world, my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews: but my kingdom is not here.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>Then Pilate said to him, Are you then a king? Jesus made answer, You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I given birth, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might give witness to what is true. Every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>Pilate said to him, True? what is true? Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I see no wrong in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover. Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?</content>

      <content>Then again they gave a loud cry, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was an outlaw.</content>

  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And they kept coming and saying, Long life to the King of the Jews! And they gave him blows with their hands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Here is the man!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry, To the cross! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and put him on the cross: I see no crime in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the Jews made answer, We have a law, and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Then Pilate said to him, You say nothing to me? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>So when these words came to Pilate's ear, he took Jesus out, seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew, Gabbatha, or the Stone Floor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>(It was the day when they made ready for the Passover; and it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, There is your King!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Then they gave a loud cry, Away with him! away with him! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Am I to put your King to death on the cross? The chief priests said in answer, We have no king but Caesar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross. And they took Jesus away;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Where they put him on the cross with two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing. The writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not put, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But Pilate made answer, What I have put in writing will not be changed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>So they said among themselves, Let this not be cut up, but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it. (They did this so that the Writings might come true, which say, They made a distribution of my clothing among them, and my coat they put to the decision of chance.) This was what the men of the army did.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him, he said to his mother, Mother, there is your son!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Then he said to the disciple, There is your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>After this, being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true, Jesus said, Give me water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>So when Jesus had taken the wine he said, All is done. And with his head bent he gave up his spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>So the men of the army came, and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead by this time, and so his legs were not broken;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And he who saw it has given witness (and his witness is true; he is certain that what he says is true) so that you may have belief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>These things came about so that the Writings might be true, No bone of his body will be broken.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And again another verse says, They will see him who was wounded by their spears.</content>

      <content>After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate said he might do so. So he went and took away his body.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And Nicodemus came (he who had first come to Jesus by night) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed, about a hundred pounds.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>So they put Jesus there, because it was the Jews' day of getting ready for the Passover, and the place was near.</content>

  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now on the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Then she went running to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>They went running together, and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And looking in, he saw the linen bands on the earth; but he did not go in,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock; and he saw the linen bands on the earth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the cloth, which had been round his head, not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then the other disciple who came there first went in; and he saw and belief came to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>So then the disciples went away again to their houses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock, weeping; and while she was weeping and looking into the hole,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head and the other at the feet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I have no knowledge where they have put him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And then looking round, she saw Jesus there, but had no idea that it was Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master).</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples, and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>At evening on that day, the first day of the week, when, for fear of the Jews, the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus came among them and said to them, May peace be with you!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Any to whom you give forgiveness, will be made free from their sins; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness, will still be in their sins.</content>

    <verse num="24">
      <content>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, named Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>So the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails, and if I do not put my hand into his side, I will never have belief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And after eight days, his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came, and taking his place in the middle of them, he said, May peace be with you!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Then he said to Thomas, Put out your finger, and see my hands; and put your hand here into my side: and be no longer in doubt but have belief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And Thomas said in answer, My Lord and my God!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me you have belief: a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>But these are recorded, so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, having this faith you may have life in his name.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and it came about in this way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Simon Peter, Thomas named Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were all together.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, And we will come with you. They went out and got into the boat; but that night they took no fish.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea (though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus).</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So Jesus said to them, Children, have you taken any fish? They made answer, No.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter, It is the Lord! Hearing that it was the Lord, Peter put his coat round him (because he was not clothed) and went into the sea.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish cooking on it, and bread.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there was such a number the net was not broken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Jesus said to them, Come and take some food. And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question, Who are you? being conscious that it was the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Again, a second time, he said to him, Simon, son of John, have you any love for me? Yes, Lord, he said, you are certain of my love for you. Then take care of my sheep, said Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me. Jesus said to him, Then give my sheep food.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Then Peter, turning round, saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them--the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal, and said, Lord, who is it who will be false to you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, What about this man?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Jesus said to him, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you? come yourself after me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death: Jesus, however, did not say that he would not undergo death, but, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing: and we have knowledge that his witness is true.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be.</content>
