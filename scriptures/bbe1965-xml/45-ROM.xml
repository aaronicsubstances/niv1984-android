    <verse num="1">
      <content>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, an Apostle by the selection of God, given authority as a preacher of the good news,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Of which God had given word before by his prophets in the holy Writings,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>About his Son who, in the flesh, came from the family of David,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But was marked out as Son of God in power by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead; Jesus Christ our Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Through whom grace has been given to us, sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations, for his name:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>To all those who are in Rome, loved by God, marked out as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>First of all, I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because news of your faith has gone into all the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For God is my witness, whose servant I am in spirit in the good news of his Son, that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And that I am ever making prayers that God will give me a good journey to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For I have a strong desire to see you, and to give you some grace of the spirit, so that you may be made strong;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>That is to say, that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>You may be certain, my brothers, that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you (but till now I was kept from it), so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I have had it from the other nations.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I have a debt to Greeks and to the nations outside; to the wise and to those who have no learning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For which reason I have the desire, as far as I am able, to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in Rome.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For I have no feeling of shame about the good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first, and then to the Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is said in the holy Writings, The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Because the knowledge of God may be seen in them, God having made it clear to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For from the first making of the world, those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, his eternal power and existence, are fully made clear, he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made, so that men have no reason for wrongdoing:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Because, having the knowledge of God, they did not give glory to God as God, and did not give praise, but their minds were full of foolish things, and their hearts, being without sense, were made dark.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Seeming to be wise, they were in fact foolish,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And by them the glory of the eternal God was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal, and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For this reason God gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts, working shame in their bodies with one another:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Because by them the true word of God was changed into that which is false, and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made, and not to him who made it, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For this reason God gave them up to evil passions, and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another, men doing shame with men, and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil-doing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And because they had not the mind to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an evil mind, to do those things which are not right;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Being full of all wrongdoing, evil, desire for the goods of others, hate, envy, putting to death, fighting, deceit, cruel ways, evil talk, and false statements about others;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Hated by God, full of pride, without respect, full of loud talk, given to evil inventions, not honouring father or mother,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Without knowledge, not true to their undertakings, unkind, having no mercy:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Who, though they have knowledge of the law of God, that the fate of those who do these things is death, not only go on doing these things themselves, but give approval to those who do them.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>So you have no reason, whoever you are, for judging: for in judging another you are judging yourself, for you do the same things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And we are conscious that God is a true judge against those who do such things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself, are you hoping that God's decision will not take effect against you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you, waiting and putting up with you for so long, not seeing that in his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Who will give to every man his right reward:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal life:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But to those who, from a love of competition, are not guided by what is true, will come the heat of his wrath,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil, to the Jew first and then to the Greek;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good, to the Jew first and then to the Greek:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For one man is not different from another before God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>All those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law: and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before God, but only the doers:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For when the Gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law, they are a law to themselves;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts, their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it, while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men, as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher, through Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But as for you who have the name of Jew, and are resting on the law, and take pride in God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And have knowledge of his desires, and are a judge of the things which are different, having the learning of the law,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>In the belief that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in the dark,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>A teacher of the foolish, having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>You who give teaching to others, do you give it to yourself? you who say that a man may not take what is not his, do you take what is not yours?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>You who take pride in the law, are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law, but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law, will it not be credited to them as circumcision?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And they, by their keeping of the law without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly, and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>But he is a Jew who is a secret one, whose circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>How then is the Jew better off? or what profit is there in circumcision?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Much in every way: first of all because the words of God were given to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And if some have no faith, will that make the faith of God without effect?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>In no way: but let God be true, though every man is seen to be untrue; as it is said in the Writings, That your words may be seen to be true, and you may be seen to be right when you are judged.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But if the righteousness of God is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said? is it wrong for God to be angry (as men may say)?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>In no way: because if it is so, how is God able to be the judge of all the world?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But if, because I am untrue, God being seen to be true gets more glory, why am I to be judged as a sinner?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Let us not do evil so that good may come (a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made), because such behaviour will have its right punishment.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>What then? are we worse off than they? In no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>As it is said in the holy Writings, There is not one who does righteousness;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Not one who has the knowledge of what is right, not one who is a searcher after God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>They have all gone out of the way, there is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much as one:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Their throat is like an open place of death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of snakes is under their lips:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Their feet are quick in running after blood;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Destruction and trouble are in their ways;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And of the way of peace they have no knowledge:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Now, we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all men may be judged by God:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the law and the prophets;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>That is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all those who have faith; and one man is not different from another,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And they may have righteousness put to their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And to make clear his righteousness now, so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>What reason, then, is there for pride? It is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>For this reason, then, a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>If God is one; and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision, and through faith to those who have not circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Do we, then, through faith make the law of no effect? in no way: but we make it clear that the law is important.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>What, then, may we say that Abraham, our father after the flesh, has got?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if Abraham got righteousness by works, he has reason for pride; but not before God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But what does it say in the holy Writings? And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now, the reward is credited to him who does works, not as of grace but as a debt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his account as righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing, and whose sins are covered.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Is this blessing, then, for the circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>How, then, was it judged? when he had circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did not have it:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their account;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For God's word, that the earth would be his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word of God has no power;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For the outcome of the law is wrath; but where there is no law it will not be broken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>(As it is said in the holy Writings, I have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things which are not are as if they were.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Who without reason for hope, in faith went on hoping, so that he became the father of a number of nations, as it had been said, So will your seed be.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And being certain that God was able to keep his word.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Now, it was not because of him only that this was said,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But for us in addition, to whose account it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Who was put to death for our evil-doing, and came to life again so that we might have righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For which reason, because we have righteousness through faith, let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Through whom, in the same way, we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And not only so, but let us have joy in our troubles: in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And waiting gives experience; and experience, hope:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And hope does not put to shame; because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For when we were still without strength, at the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man, though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But God has made clear his love to us, in that, when we were still sinners, Christ gave his life for us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Much more, if we now have righteousness by his blood, will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For if, when we were haters of God, the death of his Son made us at peace with him, much more, now that we are his friends, will we have salvation through his life;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And not only so, but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Because, till the law came, sin was in existence, but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But still death had power from Adam till Moses, even over those who had not done wrong like Adam, who is a picture of him who was to come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man. For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for the effect of one man's sin was punishment by the decision of God, but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>So then, as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men.</content>

  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Is it not clear, my brothers (I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law), that the law has power over a man as long as he is living?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living; but if her husband is dead, she is free from the law of the husband.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>So if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband: but if the husband is dead, she is free from the law, so that she is not untrue, even if she takes another man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>In the same way, my brothers, you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, even to him who came again from the dead, so that we might give fruit to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But now we are free from the law, having been made dead to that which had power over us; so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the letter.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>What then is to be said? is the law sin? in no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another's.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right.</content>

      <content>For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the way of the Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh, but those who go in the way of the Spirit, to the things of the Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to you, by which we say, Abba, Father.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God:</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say;</content>

    <verse num="27">
      <content>And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God.</content>

      <content>And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers:</content>

      <content>And those who were marked out by him were named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory.</content>

      <content>But I say, Had Israel no knowledge? First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>What then? That which Israel was searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>As it was said in the holy Writings, God gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which have no hearing, to this day.</content>
