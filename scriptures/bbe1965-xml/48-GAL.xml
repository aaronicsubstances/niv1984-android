      <content>Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead),</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Who gave himself for our sins, so that he might make us free from this present evil world, after the purpose of our God and Father:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him;</content>

    <verse num="24">
      <content>And they gave glory to God in me.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man's person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>(Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles);</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing.</content>

  <chapter num="3" preferred_title="Galatians">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>O foolish Galatians, by what strange powers have you been tricked, to whom it was made clear that Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Give me an answer to this one question, Did the Spirit come to you through the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Are you so foolish? having made a start in the Spirit, will you now be made complete in the flesh?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose? if it is in fact to no purpose.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>He who gives you the Spirit, and does works of power among you, is it by the works of law, or by the hearing of faith?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Even as Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Be certain, then, that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the holy Writings, seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith, gave the good news before to Abraham, saying, In you will all the nations have a blessing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse: because it is said in the Writings, A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God, is clear; because, The upright will be living by faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will have life by them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Christ has made us free from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: because it is said in the Writings, A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Brothers, as men would say, even a man's agreement, when it has been made certain, may not be put on one side, or have additions made to it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Now to Abraham were the undertakings given, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as of a great number; but as of one, he says, And to your seed, which is Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Because if the heritage is by the law, it is no longer dependent on the word of God; but God gave it to Abraham by his word.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>What then is the law? It was an addition made because of sin, till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now a go-between is not a go-between of one; but God is one.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Is the law then against the words of God? in no way; because if there had been a law which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>However, the holy Writings have put all things under sin, so that that for which God gave the undertaking, based on faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who have such faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But before faith came, we were kept in prison under the law, waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>There is no Jew or Greek, servant or free, male or female: because you are all one in Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and yours is the heritage by the right of God's undertaking given to Abraham.</content>

      <content>Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me.</content>

      <content>Say, you whose desire it is to be under the law, do you not give ear to the law?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman, and one by the free woman.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children.</content>

      <content>But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God.</content>
