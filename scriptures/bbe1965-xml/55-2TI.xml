    <verse num="1">
      <content>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, in the hope of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>To Timothy, my well-loved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>I give praise to God, whose servant I have been, with a heart free from sin, from the time of my fathers, because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me, night and day</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Desiring to see you, keeping in my memory your weeping, so that I may be full of joy;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Having in mind your true faith, which first was in your mother's mother Lois, and in your mother Eunice, and, I am certain, is now in you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For this reason I say to you, Let that grace of God which is in you, given to you by my hands, have living power.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of self-control.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Have no feeling of shame, then, for the witness of our Lord or for me, his prisoner: but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Who gave us salvation, marking us out for his purpose, not on account of our works, but in the measure of his purpose and his grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But has now been made clear by the revelation of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who put an end to death and made life unending come to light through the good news,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Of which I was made a preacher and an Apostle and a teacher;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And for which I undergo these things: but I have no feeling of shame. For I have knowledge of him in whom I have faith, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have given into his care till that day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Keep the form of those true words which you had from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>That good thing which was given to you keep safe, through the Holy Spirit which is in us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>You have had news that all those in Asia went away from me; among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help, and had no feeling of shame because I was in chains;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But when he was in Rome, he went in search of me everywhere, and came to me</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>(May he have the Lord's mercy in that day); and of all he did for me at Ephesus you have full knowledge.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>So then, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the things which I have said to you before a number of witnesses, give to those of the faith, so that they may be teachers of others.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Be ready to do without the comforts of life, as one of the army of Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>A fighting man, when he is with the army, keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>It is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Give thought to what I say; for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Keep in mind Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, who came back from the dead, as my good news gives witness:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>In which I put up with the hardest conditions, even prison chains, like one who has done a crime; but the word of God is not in chains.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But I undergo all things for the saints, so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>This is a true saying: If we undergo death with him, then will we be living with him:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>If we go on to the end, then we will be ruling with him: if we say we have no knowledge of him, then he will say he has no knowledge of us:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>If we are without faith, still he keeps faith, for he will never be untrue to himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Put these things before them, giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words, which is of no profit, only causing error in their hearers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Let it be your care to get the approval of God, as a workman who has no cause for shame, giving the true word in the right way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But take no part in wrong and foolish talk, for those who do so will go farther into evil,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh: such are Hymenaeus and Philetus;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Men whose ideas are all false, who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place, overturning the faith of some.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But God's strong base is unchanging, having this sign, The Lord has knowledge of those who are his: and, Let everyone by whom the name of the Lord is named be turned away from evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but others of wood and earth, and some which are honoured and some without honour.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>If a man makes himself clean from these, he will be a vessel for honour, made holy, ready for the master's use, ready for every good work.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young, and go after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings, seeing that they are a cause of trouble.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble, but he is to be gentle to all, ready in teaching, putting up with wrong,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Gently guiding those who go against the teaching; if by chance God may give them a change of heart and true knowledge,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And so they may get themselves free from the net of the Evil One, being made the prisoners of the Lord's servant, for the purpose of God.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>But be certain of this, that in the last days times of trouble will come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, uplifted in pride, given to bitter words, going against the authority of their fathers, never giving praise, having no religion,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Without natural love, bitter haters, saying evil of others, violent and uncontrolled, hating all good,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>False to their friends, acting without thought, lifted up in mind, loving pleasure more than God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Having a form of religion, but turning their backs on the power of it: go not with these.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For these are they who go secretly into houses, making prisoners of foolish women, weighted down with sin, turned from the way by their evil desires,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of what is true.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And as James and Jambres went against Moses, so do these go against what is true: men of evil minds, who, tested by faith, are seen to be false.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But they will go no farther: for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men, as theirs was in the end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But you took as your example my teaching, behaviour, purpose, and faith; my long waiting, my love, my quiet undergoing of trouble;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>My punishments and pain; the things which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; the cruel attacks made on me: and the Lord made me free from them all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Yes, and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, will be cruelly attacked.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Evil and false men will become worse and worse, using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain, conscious of who has been your teacher;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And that from the time when you were a child, you have had knowledge of the holy Writings, which are able to make you wise to salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Every holy Writing which comes from God is of profit for teaching, for training, for guiding, for education in righteousness:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So that the man of God may be complete, trained and made ready for every good work.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>I give you orders, before God and Christ Jesus, who will be the judge of the living and the dead, and by his revelation and his kingdom;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Be preaching the word at all times, in every place; make protests, say sharp words, give comfort, with long waiting and teaching;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For the time will come when they will not take the true teaching; but, moved by their desires, they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And shutting their ears to what is true, will be turned away to belief in foolish stories.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But be self-controlled in all things, do without comfort, go on preaching the good news, completing the work which has been given you to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For I am even now being offered, and my end is near.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>I have made a good fight, I have come to the end of my journey, I have kept the faith:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>From now on, the crown of righteousness is made ready for me, which the Lord, the upright judge, Will give to me at that day: and not only to me, but to all those who have had love for his revelation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Do your best to come to me before long:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For Demas has gone away from me, for love of this present life, and has gone to Thessalonica: Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and take him with you; for he is of use to me in the work.</content>

      <content>Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>The coat which I did not take from Troas and which is with Carpus, get when you come, and the books, specially the papers.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>Alexander the copper-worker did me much wrong: the Lord will give him the reward of his works:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But be on the watch for him, for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>At my first meeting with my judges, no one took my part, but all went away from me. May it not be put to their account.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But the Lord was by my side and gave me strength; so that through me the news might be given out in full measure, and all the Gentiles might give ear: and I was taken out of the mouth of the lion.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>The Lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven: to whom be glory for ever and ever. So be it.</content>
