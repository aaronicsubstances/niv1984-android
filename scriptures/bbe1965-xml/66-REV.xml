      <content>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and a great voice at my back, as of a horn, came to my ears,</content>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>To the angel of the church in Ephesus say: These things says he who has the seven stars in his right hand, who is walking in the middle of the seven gold lights:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I have knowledge of your doings, and of your hard work and long waiting, and that you will not put up with evil men, and have put to the test those who say they are Apostles and are not, and have seen that they are false;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And you have the power of waiting, and have undergone trouble because of my name, without weariness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But I have this against you, that you are turned away from your first love.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So keep in mind where you were at first, and be changed in heart and do the first works; or I will come to you, and will take away your light from its place, if your hearts are not changed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But at least you have the credit of hating the works of the Nicolaitans, as I do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give of the fruit of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Have no fear of the things which you will have to undergo: see, the Evil One will send some of you into prison, so that you may be put to the test; and you will have great trouble for ten days. Be true till death, and I will give you the crown of life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not come under the power of the second death.</content>

      <content>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos say: These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>I have knowledge that your living-place is where Satan has his seat: and you are true to my name, and were not turned away from your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my true witness, who was put to death among you, where Satan has his place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But I have some things against you, because you have with you those who keep the teaching of Balaam, by whose suggestion Balak made the children of Israel go out of the right way, taking food which was offered to false gods, and going after the desires of the flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And you have those who keep the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>See, then, that you have a change of heart; or I will come to you quickly, and will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give of the secret manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name, of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira say: These things says the Son of God, whose eyes are like a flame of fire, and his feet like polished brass:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>I have knowledge of your works, and your love and faith and help and strength in trouble, and that your last works are more than the first.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>But I have this against you, that you let the woman Jezebel say she is a prophet and give false teaching, making my servants go after the desires of the flesh and take food offered to false gods.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And I gave her time for a change of heart, but she has no mind to give up her unclean ways.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>See, I will put her into a bed, and those who make themselves unclean with her, into great trouble, if they go on with her works.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And I will put her children to death; and all the churches will see that I am he who makes search into the secret thoughts and hearts of men: and I will give to every one of you the reward of your works.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But to you I say, to the rest in Thyatira, even to those who have not this teaching, and have no knowledge of the secrets of Satan, as they say; I put on you no other weight.</content>

    <verse num="25">
      <content>But what you have, keep safe till I come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>He who overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, to him I will give rule over the nations,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And he will be ruling them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of the potter they will be broken, even as I have power from my Father:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And I will give him the morning star.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Be on the watch, and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death; because as judged by me your works have not come up to God's measure.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Keep in mind, then, the teaching which was given to you, and be ruled by it and have a change of heart. If then you do not keep watch, I will come like a thief, and you will have no knowledge of the hour when I will come on you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But you have some names in Sardis who have kept clean their robes; and as a reward they will go in white with me.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>I have knowledge of your works (see, I have put before you an open door which may be shut by no one), and that you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have been true to my name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>See, I will make those of the Synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and are not, but say what is false; I will make them come and give worship before your feet, and see my love for you.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>Because you have kept my word in quiet strength, I will keep you from the hour of testing which is coming on all the world, to put to the test those who are on earth.</content>

      <content>Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the house of my God, and he will go out no more: and I will put on him the name of my God, and the name of the town of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>If you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire, so that you may have true wealth; and white robes to put on, so that your shame may not be seen; and oil for your eyes, so that you may see.</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>Straight away I was in the Spirit: and I saw a high seat in heaven, and one was seated on it;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And to my eyes he was like a jasper and a sardius stone: and there was an arch of light round the high seat, like an emerald.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And round about the high seat were four and twenty seats: and on them I saw four and twenty rulers seated, clothed in white robes; and on their heads crowns of gold.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And out of the high seat came flames and voices and thunders. And seven lights of fire were burning before the high seat, which are the seven Spirits of God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And before the high seat there was, as it seemed, a clear sea of glass; and in the middle of the high seat, and round about it, four beasts full of eyes round about.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the first beast was like a lion, and the second like an ox, and the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the four beasts, having every one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and inside: and without resting day and night, they say, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, Ruler of all, who was and is and is to come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat, to him who is living for ever and ever,</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>The four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat, and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever, and take off their crowns before the high seat, saying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>It is right, our Lord and our God, for you to have glory and honour and power: because by you were all things made, and by your desire they came into being.</content>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat, a book with writing inside it and on the back, shut with seven stamps of wax.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And I saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice, Who is able to make the book open, and to undo its stamps?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And no one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to get the book open, or to see what was in it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">

    <verse num="5">
      <content>And one of the rulers said to me, Do not be sad: see, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome, and has power to undo the book and its seven stamps.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And I saw in the middle of the high seat and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the rulers, a Lamb in his place, which seemed as if it had been put to death, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And he came and took it out of the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the Lamb, having every one an instrument of music, and gold vessels full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And their voices are sounding in a new song, saying, It is right for you to take the book and to make it open: for you were put to death and have made an offering to God of your blood for men of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">

    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And when the fifth stamp was undone, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of God, and for the witness which they kept.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>And they gave a great cry, saying, How long will it be, O Ruler, holy and true, before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth?</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>And there was given to every one a white robe, and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time, till the number was complete of the other servants, their brothers, who would be put to death, even as they had been.</content>
