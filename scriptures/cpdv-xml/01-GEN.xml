    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> Heaven was created first, then earth. The creation of angels also occurred with the creation of heaven. The creation of earth is really the creation of the universe, and subsequently earth.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content> After earth was created, it was empty and unoccupied. Darkness is plural in the Latin. This could symbolize fallen angels, with the abyss symbolizing Hell. The word &#8216;darknesses&#8217; can also refer to the absences of so many good things, so that God had to continue creating. The Spirit of God was brought or was carried over the waters, passive tense.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content> God created light. Darkness, as the absence of light, became by default. Similarly with evil. God created the heavens and the angels, but some angels fell and so Hell (the abyss) was created.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="4">
      <content> God divided light from darkness. He also divided Heaven from Hell, once Hell was created (or became necessary due to&#160;the angels that fell from grace). Notice that God chooses to create Heaven and Earth (Universe), but Hell comes about as a result of sin. God creates Good, but Evil comes about because of sin. God does not directly create evil or darkness.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="5">
      <content> The first day is not a day as we count time, but merely the first period of time, of unspecified length, in the universe. Science agrees that first the Universe was created, and there was no life in the first time period, for the Universe was void and unoccupied. And when the earth first became, it was void and lifeless.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="6">
      <content> This verse introduces a useful ambiguity, whereby the word &#8216;terra&#8217; can refer to the entire Earth, or to the land (soil or ground), or to a particular land, e.g. &#8216;Terram Chanaan.&#8217; A similar ambiguity exists with the word &#8216;caeli&#8217; referring either to Heaven, or to the sky.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="7">
      <content> Notice that God commands the earth to produce plant-life (&#8216;herbam virentem&#8217;). He miraculously created heaven and earth out of nothing, but he causes the plant-life to be produced out of what already exists, the land. This text supports the idea, found in science, that life developed from existing inanimate matter. But the text also clearly teaches the truth that the entire process of creation and the development of creation is caused by God and is under His Providence.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="8">
      <content> The word &#8216;genus&#8217; from verse 11 is more general than the word &#8216;speciem&#8217; in verse 12. The fruit-bearing trees have their seed within the fruit, and each particular type of fruit has its own type of seed and manner of sowing.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="9">
      <content> In this next step within the development of creation, God creates the first creatures that have living souls (but not immortal souls) within the sea. Again, science agrees, teaching that the first animals were in the water, not on the land. The word &#8216;reptile&#8217; in Latin is not equivalent to the English word &#8216;reptile.&#8217; The best translation in this context is probably either &#8216;moving creatures&#8217; or &#8216;animals.&#8217; The text is contrasting the moving creatures of the waters with the plants.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="10">
      <content> The word &#8216;cete&#8217; in ancient times was probably not specific to whales, but referred to any large sea creature.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="11">
      <content> Again, the word &#8216;genere&#8217; is more general, while the word &#8216;species&#8217; is more specific. If these two words were translated by the same word in English, then there would be an unnecessary redundancy in the text. And here again we see that &#8216;reptile&#8217; is not specifically reptiles, or even crawling things, but is even more general, referring to every type of moving creature (animal) on land. These creatures are contrasted with the moving creatures of the waters, as well as the plants, of the previous verses. Therefore, the term is more general than crawling things. The mention of cattle and wild beasts are merely specific examples of familiar types of moving creatures, with living souls, on land.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="12">
      <content> So, plants were the first life created, then moving creatures of the sea, then moving creatures of the land. This is the same order of development in creation taught by science (although Scripture omits mention of microscopic organisms, with which the ancients were unfamiliar).</content>
    </note>
    <note num="13">
      <content> The word &#8216;hominem&#8217; in this verse is not capitalized, whereas in the previous verse it is capitalized. The previous verse uses Man (capitalized) to refer to all humankind; the male word &#8216;man&#8217; is used to refer to all of humanity because, in God&#8217;s plan, the human race is to be led by men. This verse uses man (not capitalized) to refer to humankind, with a particular emphasis on males. All human persons are created in God&#8217;s image and likeness. Yet, when men and women are considered in their relation to one another, men are an image of God and women are an image of Creation.</content>

      <content>Therefore, the Lord God, having formed from the soil all the animals of the earth and all the flying creatures of the air, brought them to Adam, in order to see what he would call them. For whatever Adam would call any living creature, that would be its name.</content>

      <content> In other words, this was the time before agriculture, when the trees and plants were wild and not yet cultivated.

      <content> Augustine and others say that this passage refers to the lineages of Seth and Cain, the one being holy and close to God, and the other living apart from God. My suggestion is a more generalized version of what Augustine said, namely, that the sons of God are those who stayed close to God in their lives, and the sons of men are those who lived merely secular lives. In the Bible, the term 'sons of' does not necessarily connotate lineage. For example, those who commit adultery are called, 'sons of adulterers,' not because their parents were also adulterers, but because they act as if they were sons of adultery personified. There were, in ancient times, prior to any organized religion as we have today, some who were holy, who lived close to God, and who, as a result, lived long lives. But these sons of God were attracted to women who were not holy, who lived secular lives. Thus God generally limits the length of our lives because of sin.</content>

      <content> The giants were perhaps those who were giants in their mental stature, not so much in their physical stature. There may also have been stark differences in the physical characteristics of different groups of people, due to small gene pools, in groups separated by tribe or lineage. Some groups may have been markedly larger or stronger than others. The sons of the sons of God and the daughters of men were mighty because God blesses the offspring of those who are holy.</content>

      <content> This Haran might not be the same as the brother of Nachor. This Haran is the father of Milcah and Iscah, whereas the other Haran is the father of Lot.  This also explains the redundancy of saying that Milcah is Haran&#8217;s daughter, and then saying that Haran is the father of Milcah and Iscah.</content>

      <content> The expression &#8216;aquam vivam&#8217; has a dual meaning. It refers to water that continually pours forth (perhaps similar to an artesian well). It also has a spiritual meaning, as found in the Gospels. The torrent is a wadi, in other words, a dry stream bed that is a rushing torrent in the rainy season (perhaps only one or two months a year). The word torrentem in Latin can refer to something that is hot and dry, or to a rushing stream.</content>

      <content>And when he had heard that Jacob, his sister&#8217;s son, had arrived, he ran to meet him. And embracing him, and kissing him heartily, he brought him into his house. But when he had heard the reasons for his journey,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>he responded, &#8220;You are my bone and my flesh.&#8221; And after the days of one month were completed,</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>he said to him: &#8220;Though you are my brother, will you serve me for nothing? Tell me what wages you would accept.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>In truth, he had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah; and truly the younger was called Rachel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But while Leah was bleary-eyed, Rachel had an elegant appearance and was attractive to behold.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And Jacob, loving her, said, &#8220;I will serve you for seven years, for your younger daughter Rachel.&#8221;</content>

      <content>Laban responded, &#8220;It is better that I give her to you than to another man; remain with me.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Therefore, Jacob served for seven years for Rachel. And these seemed like only a few days, because of the greatness of love.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And he said to Laban, &#8220;Give my wife to me. For now the time has been fulfilled, so that I may go in to her.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And he, having called a great crowd of his friends to the feast, agreed to the marriage.</content>

      <content>And at night, he brought in his daughter Leah to him,</content>

      <content>giving his daughter a handmaid named Zilpah. After Jacob had gone in to her, according to custom, when morning had arrived, he saw Leah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And he said to his father-in-law, &#8220;What is it that you intended to do? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Laban responded, &#8220;It is not the practice in this place to give the younger in marriage first.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Complete a week of days with this mating. And then I will give this one to you also, for the service that you will provide to me for another seven years.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>He agreed to his pleading. And after the week had passed, he took Rachel as a wife.</content>

      <content>To her, the father had given Bilhah as her servant.</content>
    </verse>

    <verse num="31">
      <content>But the Lord, seeing that he despised Leah, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Having conceived, she gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, saying: &#8220;The Lord saw my humiliation; now my husband will love me.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And again she conceived and bore a son, and she said, &#8220;Because the Lord heard that I was treated with contempt, he has also given this one to me.&#8221; And she called his name Simeon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And she conceived a third time, and she gave birth to another son, and she said: &#8220;Now likewise my husband will unite with me, because I have borne him three sons.&#8221; And because of this, she called his name Levi.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>A fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and she said, &#8220;Only now will I confess to the Lord.&#8221; And for this reason, she called him Judah. And she ceased from child-bearing.</content>

    <note num="1">
      <content> This is one of very many examples where &#8216;brother&#8217; is used more loosely in Scripture. Jacob was not the brother or Laban, but rather a close male relative, i.e. a brother in the broader sense of the word.</content>

      <content> The Angel says, &#8216;I am the God of Bethel....&#8217; because the Angel was sent to convey God&#8217;s words to Jacob. In ancient times, when one wanted to convey a message to someone, one would send another person, usually a youth, to that someone to repeat your words to them. So it made perfect sense to Jacob that God would send an Angel (a messenger of God) convey a message by repeating God&#8217;s words to Jacob.</content>

      <content> Here is a verse whereby the Bible comments on its own translation, permitting an event to be described with varied wording, as best fits the language into which it is translated. Also, note that what each one chooses to call it reveals his attitude towards the agreement. Laban&#8217;s &#8216;tumulum&#8217; can be translated as &#8216;tomb&#8217; (cf. Job 10:19). Laban was losing his daughters, flocks, and son-in-law (a valuable employee); this loss was like a kind of death to him. But Jacob thought little of this agreement, for it was merely an agreement to let him have what was already justly his. So he calls it &#8216;acervum,&#8217; which means &#8216;little hill&#8217; or &#8216;pile&#8217; or &#8216;heap.&#8217;</content>

      <content> The verb &#8216;respicit&#8217; does not merely mean &#8216;to see.&#8217; It means to see and understand, or to look with the intention of understanding. And the word &#8216;praesens&#8217; is the word &#8216;sens&#8217; (a form of the verb &#8216;to be&#8217;) and the prefix &#8216;prae&#8217; which means &#8216;before.&#8217; As a phrase taken as a whole, and in this context, &#8216;pr&#230;sens respicit&#8217; means to understand beforehand.</content>

This drought would reduce the amount of crops that could be grown to the extent that they could not (or would not) save some seed for the next crop. The drought would also keep the Nile from flooding its banks (which would have provided water and rich soil for crops grown in the flood plain).</content>

      <content>Cursed be their fury, because it was obstinate, and their indignation, because it was harsh. I will divide them in Jacob, and I will scatter them in Israel.</content>

      <content> This passage is the eschatological discourse of Jacob. It describes the state of the twelve parts of the one Catholic Church prior to the Return of Christ. Currently, the Church as two parts, east and west. After the unification of all the Christian Churches in one Catholic Church (in the early 2020&#8217;s), there will be seven parts within the one Church. Much later, these seven will become twelve parts of one Church, like the twelve tribes of Israel. It is these twelve tribes of the future Church that Jacob describes on his death bed.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Joseph, realizing this, fell upon his father&#8217;s face, weeping and kissing him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he instructed his servant physicians to embalm his father with aromatics.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And while they were fulfilling his orders, forty days passed. For this was the method of embalming dead bodies. And Egypt wept for him for seventy days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And when the time for mourning was fulfilled, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharaoh: &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, speak to the ears of Pharaoh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For my father made me swear, saying: &#8216;See, I am dying. You shall bury me in my sepulcher which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&#8217; Therefore, I shall go up and bury my father, and then return.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And Pharaoh said to him, &#8220;Go up and bury your father, just as he made you swear.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So as he went up, all the elders of the house of Pharaoh went with him, along with every patriarch in the land of Egypt,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>and the house of Joseph with his brothers, except their little ones and flocks and also the herds, which they left behind in the land of Goshen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Likewise, he had in his company chariots and horsemen. And it became a crowd without restraint.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And they arrived at the threshing place of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan. There they spent seven full days celebrating the funeral rites with a great and vehement lamentation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And when the inhabitants of the land of Canaan had seen this, they said, &#8220;This is a great Lamentation for the Egyptians.&#8221; And for this reason, the name of that place was called, &#8220;The Lamentation of Egypt.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And so, the sons of Jacob did just as he had instructed them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And carrying him into the land of Canaan, they buried him in the double cave, which Abraham had bought along with its field, from Ephron the Hittite, as a possession for burial, opposite Mamre.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brothers and all those of his company, having buried his father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Now that he was dead, his brothers were afraid, and they said to one another: &#8220;Perhaps now he may remember the injury that he suffered and requite us for all the evil that we did to him.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So they sent a message to him, saying: &#8220;Your father instructed us before he died,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>that we should say these words to you from him: &#8216;I beg you to forget the wickedness of your brothers, and the sin and malice that they practiced against you.&#8217; Likewise, we petition you to release the servants of the God of your father from this iniquity.&#8221; Hearing this, Joseph wept.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And his brothers went to him. And reverencing prostrate on the ground, they said, &#8220;We are your servants.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And he answered them: &#8220;Do not be afraid. Are we able to resist the will of God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>You devised evil against me. But God turned it into good, so that he might exalt me, just as you presently discern, and so that he might bring about the salvation of many peoples.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Do not be afraid. I will pasture you and your little ones.&#8221; And he consoled them, and he spoke mildly and leniently.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And he lived in Egypt with all his father&#8217;s house; and he survived for one hundred and ten years. And he saw the sons of Ephraim to the third generation. Likewise, the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born onto Joseph&#8217;s knees.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>After these things happened, he said to his brothers: &#8220;God will visit you after my death, and he will make you ascend from this land into the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And when he had made them swear and had said, &#8220;God will visit you; carry my bones with you from this place,&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>he died, having completed one hundred and ten years of his life. And having been embalmed with aromatics, he was laid to rest in a coffin in Egypt.</content>
