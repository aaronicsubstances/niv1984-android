      <content> The Sabbatical year, in the times before Herod the great captured Jerusalem, was counted from spring to spring, not from fall to fall, as the Jews today count it. The Jews could plant in the fall of year 6; they could not harvest the following spring, because year 7, the Sabbatical year, had begun. But there would be a full crop in the field from the previous fall&#8217;s planting. Then, in the fall of year 7, the crop would self-sow, producing a full crop for harvest in year 8, that is, in year 1 of the next cycle of seven years. But the Jubilee year began in the fall, that is, in the fall of year 7. So the following spring, in year 8, they still could not harvest the crop, but again they could eat from the field what had self-sown the previous fall. Then in the fall of year 8 the Jubilee year would be over, since it began in the fall of the previous year, overlapping with the end of the Sabbatical year. That is why they could then plant in the fall of year 8, because the Jubilee year was over. After the Jews changed the count of the Sabbatical years to the fall, they began to suffer from famine during Sabbatical and Jubilee years because the crops no longer self-sowed and the time for refraining from sowing and planting became extended to 2 full years, from one full Sabbatical year and one overlapping Jubilee year.</content>

      <content>And whoever of you will remain, I will send terror into their hearts in the regions of their enemies. The sound of a flying leaf will terrify them, and so they will flee, as if from the sword. They will fall, though no one pursues.</content>

      <content> Now here is a common translation dilemma; two words are used together, either one of which by itself would be translated by the same word. So both &#8216;sabbatizabit&#8217; and &#8216;requiescet&#8217; can properly be translated as &#8216;shall rest,&#8217; but when used together they must be translated differently: &#8216;worship and rest&#8217; is the fitting choice.</content>
