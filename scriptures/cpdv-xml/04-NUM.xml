      <content> The total number of Levites was actually 22,300; but the number reported as the total was 22,000. This may be due to rounding: the numbers 7,500 and 8,600 and 6200 are probably rounded to the nearest hundred; then, the 22,300 is rounded down to the nearest thousand. Getting an exact number in a census of a very large group is very difficult. Some children are passing their first month, so they enter into the count of the census; some persons die as the census is taking place. It might take weeks or months to take a census, especially since their main occupation in the desert of Sinai was tasks needed to survive. It may also be that these numbers are symbolic; 100 is subtracted from each of the three tribes (300) to make 22,000.</content>

    <note num="3">
      <content> Notice that the number of the sons of Israel, 20 years and older, excluding the Levites, is 603,550 men; but the number of the first born males one month and older is only 22,273. This is one first born for every 27 or so males of 20 years and up, so that would be an even greater proportion if we knew how many males were between one month and 20 years. In ancient times, and up until the early 20th century, the mortality rate for infants and children was high. In human history, most persons died in childhood, until the 20th century. So the number of surviving first born sons is low.</content>

God cautions the people of Israel, and their leaders, not to permit Levites to act as if they were priests, lest a great tribulation come upon the people. Similarly, today, some religious and some lay persons are taking roles only fitting for the ordained. So this is a sign that the tribulation is near.</content>

      <content> Notice that Miriam&#8217;s name is listed first. This indicates that she was putting herself above Aaron as well as Moses, and it is a foreshadowing of those women who wish to put themselves above men by claiming to be ordained as Bishops and priests. Notice also that they first denigrate Moses by criticizing him unfairly. Then they try to life themselves up.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> This event was a foreshadowing of the rebellion in the Church against proper Church authority, against the authority of the Pope over the Bishops, against the authority of the Pope and Bishops over priests, deacons, and religious, and against the teaching of the Church that women cannot be Pope, Cardinal, Bishop, or priest in the Church. Miriam speaks as if she were equal to Moses in his role over Israel, just as some women speak as if they could be ordained as priests or Bishops, or as if it could ever be God&#8217;s will for them to lead men. God rebukes Aaron and Miriam for disdaining the roles given to each of them by God and for desiring a role not given to them. Notice also that even Miriam and Aaron know that God speaks to them, but through Moses. Yet they ignore that difference.</content>

This passage refers to the same event as Daniel 11:29-30; the middle of the Antichrist&#8217;s reign, when some Roman Catholics in Greek warships (i.e. from a democratic or formerly-democratic nation) will come against the fleet of the Antichrist. The reference to Italy has the spiritual meaning of indicating Roman Catholics, because Italy and Rome is the seat of authority of the Church. They shall overcome the Assyrians (the fleet of the Antichrist, who will be from Assyria), and also will devastate the Hebrews. The Hebrews, at that time, will be in support of the Antichrist. But notice that they are called Hebrews, not Jews. Those who are truly devout Jews will reject the Antichrist. Later, when the Antichrist is thrown down by the Archangel Michael, many of these Hebrews repent and believe in Jesus Christ. After the Antichrist is defeated in this battle, at a later time, he discovers which Catholics fought against him there and has them killed.</content>
