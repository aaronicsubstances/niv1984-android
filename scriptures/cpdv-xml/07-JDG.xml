    <verse num="1">
      <content>After the death of Joshua, the sons of Israel consulted the Lord, saying, &#8220;Who will ascend before us, against the Canaanite, and who will be the commander of the war?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the Lord said: &#8220;Judah shall ascend. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hands.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And Judah said to his brother Simeon, &#8220;Go up with me to my lot, and fight against the Canaanite, so that I also may go forth with you to your lot.&#8221; And Simeon went with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanite, as well as the Perizzite, into their hands. And they struck down ten thousand of the men at Bezek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And they found Adonibezek at Bezek, and they fought against him, and they struck down the Canaanite and the Perizzite.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then Adonibezek fled. And they pursued him and captured him, and they cut off the ends of his hands and feet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And Adonibezek said: &#8220;Seventy kings, with the ends of their hands and feet amputated, have been gathering the remnants of food under my table. Just as I have done, so has God repaid me.&#8221; And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then the sons of Judah, besieging Jerusalem, seized it. And they struck it with edge of the sword, delivering the entire city to be burned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And afterward, descending, they fought against the Canaanites who were living in the mountains, and in the south, and in the plains.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Judah, going forth against the Canaanites who were living at Hebron, (the name of which from antiquity was Kiriath-Arba) struck down Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And continuing on from there, he went to the inhabitants of Debir, the old name of which was Kiriath-Sepher, that is, the City of Letters.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And Caleb said, &#8220;Whoever will strike Kiriath-Sepher, and will lay waste to it, I will give to him my daughter Achsah as wife.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And when Othniel, the son of Kenaz, a younger brother of Caleb, had seized it, he gave his daughter Achsah to him in marriage.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And as she was traveling on a journey, her husband admonished her, so that she would request a field from her father. And since she had sighed while sitting on her donkey, Caleb said to her, &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But she responded: &#8220;Give a blessing to me. For you have given me a dry land. Also give a watered land.&#8221; Therefore, Caleb gave to her the upper watered land and the lower watered land.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Now the sons of the Kenite, the relative of Moses, ascended from the City of Palms, with the sons of Judah, into the wilderness of his lot, which is toward the south of Arad. And they lived with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then Judah went out with his brother Simeon, and together they struck the Canaanites who were living at Zephath, and they put them to death. And the name of the city was called Hormah, that is, Anathema.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And Judah seized Gaza, with its parts, and Ashkelon as well as Ekron, with their borders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And the Lord was with Judah, and he possessed the mountains. But he was not able to wipe out the inhabitants of the valley. For they abounded with chariots armed with scythes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And just as Moses had said, they gave Hebron to Caleb, who destroyed out of it the three sons of Anak.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But the sons of Benjamin did not wipe out the Jebusite inhabitants of Jerusalem. And the Jebusite has lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem, even to the present day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>The house of Joseph also ascended against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For when they were besieging the city, which was previously called Luz,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>they saw a man departing from the city, and they said to him, &#8220;Reveal to us the entrance to the city, and we will act with mercy toward you.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And when he had revealed it to them, they struck the city with the edge of the sword. But that man, and all his relatives, they released.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And having been sent away, he went out to the land of the Hittites, and he built a city there, and he called it Luz. And so it is called, even to the present day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Likewise, Manasseh did not destroy Bethshean and Taanach, with their villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor and Ibleam and Megiddo, with their villages. And the Canaanite began to live with them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Then, after Israel had grown strong, he made them tributaries, but he was not willing to destroy them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And now Ephraim did not put to death the Canaanite, who was living at Gezer; instead, he lived with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Zebulun did not wipe out the inhabitants of Kitron and of Nahalal. Instead, the Canaanite lived in their midst and became their tributary.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Likewise, Asher did not destroy the inhabitants of Acco and Sidon, Ahlab and Achzib, and Helbah, and Aphik, and Rehob.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And he lived in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of that land, for he did not put them to death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Naphtali also did not wipe out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Bethanath. And he lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. And the Beth-shemeshites and Bethanathites were tributaries to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And the Amorite hemmed in the sons of Dan on the mountain, and did not give them a place, so that they might descend to the flatlands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And he lived on the mountain at Har-heres, which is translated as &#8216;resembling brick,&#8217; and at Aijalon and Sha-alabbin. But the hand of the house of Joseph was very heavy, and he became a tributary to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>Now the border of the Amorite was from the Ascent of the Scorpion, to the Rock and the higher places.</content>

  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Judges 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And an Angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to the Place of Weeping, and he said: &#8220;I led you away from Egypt, and I led you into the land, about which I swore to your fathers. And I promised that I would not nullify my covenant with you, even forever:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>but only if you would not form a pact with the inhabitants of this land. Instead, you should overturn their altars. Yet you were not willing to listen to my voice. Why have you done this?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For this reason, I am not willing to destroy them before your face, so that you may have enemies, and so that their gods may be your ruin.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, they lifted up their voice, and they wept.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the name of that place was called, the Place of Weeping, or the Place of Tears. And they immolated victims to the Lord in that place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then Joshua dismissed the people, and the sons of Israel went away, each one to his own possession, so that they might obtain it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And they served the Lord, during all his days, and during all the days of the elders, who lived for a long time after him, and who knew all the works of the Lord, which he had done for Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred and ten years old.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And they buried him in the parts of his possession at Timnath-Serah, on Mount Ephraim, before the northern side of Mount Gaash.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And that entire generation was gathered to their fathers. And there rose up others, who had not known the Lord and the works that he had done for Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served the Baals.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had led them away from the land of Egypt. And they followed foreign gods and the gods of the peoples who were living around them, and they adored them. And they provoked the Lord to wrath,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>forsaking him, and serving Baal and Ashtaroth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And the Lord, having become angry against Israel, delivered them into the hands of plunderers, who seized them and sold them to the enemies that were living on all sides. Neither were they able to withstand their adversaries.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Instead, wherever they wanted to go, the hand of the Lord was upon them, just as he said and just as he swore to them. And they were greatly afflicted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the Lord raised up judges, who would free them from the hands of their oppressors. But they were not willing to listen to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Fornicating with foreign gods and adoring them, they quickly deserted the way along which their fathers had advanced. And having heard the commandments of the Lord, they did all things to the contrary.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And while the Lord was raising up the judges, in their days, he was moved to mercy, and he listened to the groaning of the afflicted, and he freed them from the slaughter of their oppressors.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But after a judge had died, they turned back, and they were doing much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving them, and adoring them. They did not abandon their pursuits and their very stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And the fury of the Lord was enraged against Israel, and he said: &#8220;For this people has made void my covenant, which I had formed with their fathers, and they have despised listening to my voice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And so, I will not destroy the nations that Joshua left behind when he died,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>so that, by them, I may test Israel, as to whether or not they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, just as their fathers kept it.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Therefore, the Lord left all these nations, and he was not willing to quickly overthrow them, nor did he deliver them into the hands of Joshua.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>These are the nations which the Lord left, so that by them he might instruct Israel and all who had not known the wars of the Canaanites,</content>
    </verse>

      <content>so that afterward their sons might learn to contend with their enemies, and to have a willingness to do battle:</content>

      <content>the five princes of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who were living on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-Hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath.</content>

      <content>And so, the sons of Israel lived in the midst of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</content>

      <content>And they took their daughters as wives, and they gave their own daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.</content>

      <content>And the land was quiet for forty years. And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.</content>

      <content>And he joined to him the sons of Ammon and the sons of Amalek. And he went forth and struck Israel, and he possessed the City of Palms.</content>

      <content>And afterward, they cried out to the Lord, who raised up for them a savior, called Ehud, the son of Gera, the son of Benjamin, who used either hand as well as the right hand. And the sons of Israel sent gifts to Eglon, the king of Moab, by him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And he made for himself a two-edged sword, having a handle, reaching to the middle, the length of the palm of a hand. And he was girded with it under his cloak, on the right thigh.</content>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he offered the gifts to Eglon, the king of Moab. Now Eglon was exceedingly fat.</content>

      <content>And then, returning from Gilgal where the idols were, he said to the king, &#8220;I have a secret word for you, O king.&#8221; And he ordered silence. And when all those who were around him had departed,</content>

      <content>so strongly that the handle followed the blade into the wound, and was enclosed by the great amount of fat. Neither did he withdraw the sword.

    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Then Ehud carefully closed the doors of the upper room. And securing the bars,</content>

    <verse num="24">
      <content>he departed by a back exit. And the servants of the king, entering, saw that the doors of the upper room were closed, and they said, &#8220;Perhaps he is emptying his bowels in the summer room.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And after waiting a long time, until they were embarrassed, and seeing that no one opened the door, they took the key, and opening it, they found their lord lying dead on the ground.</content>

      <content>But Ehud, while they were in confusion, escaped and passed by the place of the idols, from which he had returned. And he arrived at Seirath.</content>

      <content> Ehud presented the gifts to the king. Then he followed the companions of the king as they left the presence of the king to go out to Gilgal, where the idols were. They were perhaps thanking their gods for a successful visit with the king. Since Ehud was returning from Gilgal, the king may have assumed that Ehud had received some kind of message from the idols (the pagan gods) there. Thus he was willing to listen to Ehud alone.</content>

      <content>And Deborah said to Barak: &#8220;Rise up. For this is the day on which the Lord delivers Sisera into your hands. For he is your commander.&#8221; And so, Barak descended from Mount Tabor, and the ten thousand fighting men with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And the Lord struck Sisera with great fear, and all his chariots and all his multitude with the edge of the sword, in the sight of Barak, so much so that Sisera, leaping from his chariot, fled on foot.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>And Barak pursued the fleeing chariots, and the army, as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles. And the entire multitude of the enemy was cut down, unto utter annihilation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But Sisera, while fleeing, arrived at the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber, the Kenite. For there was peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber, the Kenite.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Therefore, Jael went out to meet Sisera, and she said to him: &#8220;Enter to me, my lord. Enter, you should not be afraid.&#8221; And he entered her tent, and having been covered by her with a cloak,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>he said to her: &#8220;Give me, I beg you, a little water. For I am very thirsty.&#8221; And she opened a bottle of milk, and she gave him to drink. And she covered him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Sisera said to her: &#8220;Stand before the door of the tent. And if anyone arrives, questioning you and saying, &#8216;Could there be any man here?&#8217; you shall respond, &#8216;There is no one.&#8217; &#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">

      <content> St. Thomas Aquinas quotes St. Gregory saying, &#8220;If you have promised ill, break your faith.&#8221; Although Jephthah promised to kill whoever met him on his return, he should not have promised. God did not give him the victory in exchange for that immoral promise, but despite the promise. This also highlights the danger of making a deal with God in prayer, where, if God&#8217;s Providence and grace grants you a favor, you promise to do something. God may want to do the favor, but He also might not want what you are promising.</content>

      <content> Notice that they were unable to solve the problem for three days (verse 14). Then verse 17 says that she wept before Samson during the seven days of the feast; it is not that she wept for seven days, but rather than she wept over several days, from day 4 to day 7, during a seven day feast. Her countrymen had been pleading with her since day 4 (or perhaps earlier). Only on day seven did their pleas reach the fever pitch of threatening to burn her and her father&#8217;s house, and on that day, she most likely pleaded more stringently (since her life was at stake), and Samson explained it to her then.</content>
