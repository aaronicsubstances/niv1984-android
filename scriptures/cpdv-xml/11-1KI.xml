    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now king David had become elderly, and he had many days in his lifetime. And though he was covered with clothes, he was not warmed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Therefore, his servants said to him: &#8220;Let us seek, for our lord the king, a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and warm him, and sleep in his bosom, and provide warmth for our lord the king.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And so they sought a beautiful young woman in all the parts of Israel. And they found Abishag, a Shunammite, and they led her to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now the girl was exceedingly beautiful. And she slept with the king, and she ministered to him. Yet truly, the king did not know her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, &#8220;I shall reign!&#8221; And he appointed for himself chariots and horsemen, with fifty men who would run before him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Neither did his father chastise him at any time, saying, &#8220;Why have you done this?&#8221; Now he, too, was very beautiful, the second in birth, after Absalom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And he conferred with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar, the priest, who gave assistance to the side of Adonijah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Yet truly, Zadok, the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Shimei and Rei, and the mature men of the army of David were not with Adonijah.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Then Adonijah, having immolated rams and calves and every kind of fat cattle beside the Stone of the Serpent, which was in the vicinity of the fountain Rogel, summoned all his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But he did not summon Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, and all the mature men, and Solomon, his brother.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And so Nathan said to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon: &#8220;Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has begun to reign, and that our lord David is ignorant of this?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now then, come, accept my counsel, and save your life and the life of your son Solomon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Go and enter to king David, and say to him: &#8216;Did you not, my lord the king, swear to me, your handmaid, saying: &#8220;Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit on my throne?&#8221; Then why does Adonijah reign?&#8217;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And while you are still speaking with the king there, I will enter after you, and I will complete your words.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And so Bathsheba entered to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag, the Shunammite, was ministering to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Bathsheba bowed herself, and she reverenced the king. And the king said to her, &#8220;What do you wish?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And responding, she said: &#8220;My lord, you swore to your handmaid, by the Lord your God: &#8216;your son Solomon will reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne.&#8217;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And now behold, Adonijah reigns, while you, my lord the king, are ignorant of it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>He has slain oxen, and every kind of fattened cattle, and many rams. And he has summoned all the sons of the king, as well as Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the leader of the military. But Solomon, your servant, he did not summon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Truly now, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel look with favor upon you, that you may indicate to them who ought to sit upon your throne, my lord the king, after you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Otherwise, this will be: when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be as sinners.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, arrived.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And they announced to the king, saying, &#8220;Nathan, the prophet, is here.&#8221; And when he had entered in the sight of the king, and he had reverenced prone on the ground,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Nathan said: &#8220;My lord the king, did you say, &#8216;Let Adonijah reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?&#8217;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For today, he descended, and he immolated oxen, and fattened cattle, and many rams. And he summoned all the sons of the king, and the leaders of the army, along with Abiathar, the priest. And they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, &#8216;As king Adonijah lives.&#8217;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But he did not summon me, your servant, and Zadok, the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon, your lowly servant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Could this word have gone out from my lord the king, and could you not have revealed it to me, your servant, as to who would be seated upon the throne of my lord the king after him?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And king David responded, saying, &#8220;Summon to me Bathsheba.&#8221; And when she had entered before the king, and she had stood before him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>the king swore and said: &#8220;As the Lord lives, who has rescued my soul from all distress,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>just as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel, saying: &#8216;Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne in my place,&#8217; so shall I do this day.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And Bathsheba, having lowered her face to the ground, reverenced the king, saying, &#8220;May my lord David live forever.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And king David said, &#8220;Summon to me Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada.&#8221; And when they had entered before the king,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>he said to them: &#8220;Take with you the servants of your lord, and place my son Solomon upon my mule. And lead him to Gihon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And let Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him in that place as the king over Israel. And you shall sound the trumpet, and you shall say, &#8216;As king Solomon lives.&#8217;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And you shall ascend after him, and he shall arrive and shall sit upon my throne. And he himself shall reign in my place. And I will command that he be the ruler over Israel and over Judah.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, responded to the king, saying: &#8220;Amen. So says the Lord, the God of my lord the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>In the same way that the Lord has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon. And may he make his throne more sublime than the throne of my lord, king David.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>Then Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, descended, with Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites. And they placed Solomon on the mule of king David, and they led him to Gihon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And Zadok, the priest, took the horn of oil from the tabernacle, and he anointed Solomon. And they sounded the trumpet. And all the people said, &#8220;As king Solomon lives.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And the entire multitude ascended after him. And the people were playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy. And the earth resounded before the noise of them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Then Adonijah, and all who had been summoned by him, heard it. And now the feast had ended. Then, too, Joab, hearing the voice of the trumpet, said, &#8220;What is the meaning of this clamor from the tumultuous city?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>While he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived. And Adonijah said to him, &#8220;Enter, for you are a valiant man, and you report good news.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And Jonathan answered Adonijah: &#8220;By no means. For our lord king David has appointed Solomon as king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>And he has sent with him Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites. And they have placed him on the mule of the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>And Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, at Gihon. And they are ascending from there, rejoicing, and so the city resounds. This is the noise that you have heard.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>But also, Solomon sits upon the throne of the kingdom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>And the servants of the king, entering, have blessed our lord king David, saying: &#8216;May God amplify the name of Solomon above your name, and may he magnify his throne above your throne.&#8217; And the king reverenced from his bed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>And he said: &#8216;Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who today has bestowed someone to sit upon my throne, while my eyes may see it.&#8217; &#8221;</content>

    <verse num="49">
      <content>Therefore, all those who had been summoned by Adonijah were terrified. And they all rose up, and each one went his own way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>Then Adonijah, fearing Solomon, rose up and went away. And he took hold of the horn of the altar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>And they reported to Solomon, saying: &#8220;Behold, Adonijah, fearing king Solomon, has taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: &#8216;May king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put to death his servant with the sword.&#8217; &#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="52">
      <content>And Solomon said: &#8220;If he is a good man, not so much as one hair of his head shall fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he shall die.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>Therefore, king Solomon sent and brought him from the altar. And entering, he reverenced king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, &#8220;Go to your own house.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The word &#8216;robur&#8217; can mean strong or robust, but it can also mean mature or experienced. So the veterans of the army, who were older and experienced in battle, were faithful to David, despite his decline in his ability to lead, because of old age. But perhaps the newer recruits were impetuous and supported the younger leader, Adonijah.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content> The people were now swearing their oaths by Solomon, indicating that he is the rightful king, &#8220;As king Solomon lives, I shall do this or that.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And observe the care of the Lord your God, so that you walk in his ways, so that you care for his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, just as it is written in the law of Moses.

    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>So may the Lord confirm his words, which he has spoken about me, saying: &#8216;If your sons will guard their ways, and if they will walk before me in truth, with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from you a man on the throne of Israel.&#8217;</content>

      <content>Also, you know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, has done to me, what he did to the two leaders of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether. He killed them, and so he shed the blood of war in peace time, and he set the bloodshed of battle on his belt, which was around his waist, and in his shoes, which were on his feet.</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>Also, you have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, the son of Benjamin, from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went away to the camp.

      <content>And so, David slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now the days during which David reigned over Israel are forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, thirty-three in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Then Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And Adonijah, the son of Haggith, entered to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said to him, &#8220;Is your entrance peaceful?&#8221; He responded, &#8220;It is peaceful.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And he added, &#8220;My word is for you.&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; And he said:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>&#8220;You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all of Israel had preferred me for themselves as king. But the kingdom was transferred, and has become my brother&#8217;s. For it was appointed to him by the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Now therefore, I beg of you one petition. May you not confound my face.&#8221; And she said to him, &#8220;Speak.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he said: &#8220;I beg that you may speak to king Solomon, for he is not able to refuse anything to you, so that he may give Abishag the Shunammite to me as wife.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And Bathsheba said: &#8220;It is well. I will speak to the king on your behalf.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Then Bathsheba went to king Solomon, so that she might speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and he reverenced her, and he sat down upon his throne. And a throne was stationed for the mother of the king, and she sat at his right hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And she said to him: &#8220;I petition one small request from you. May you not confound my face.&#8221; And the king said to her: &#8220;Ask, my mother. For it is not right that I turn away your face.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And she said, &#8220;Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah, your brother, as wife.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And king Solomon responded, and he said to his mother: &#8220;Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Why not request the kingdom for him! For he is my older brother, and he has Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And so king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: &#8220;May God do these things to me, and may he add these other things! For Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And now, as the Lord lives, who has confirmed me and placed me upon the throne of my father David, and who, just as he said, has made a house for me: Adonijah shall be put to death this day.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who put him to death, and so he died.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Also, the king said to Abiathar, the priest: &#8220;Go into Anathoth, to your own land, for you are a man worthy of death. But I will not put you to death this day, since you carried the ark of the Lord God before David, my father, and since you have endured hardship in all the things, for which my father labored.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Therefore, Solomon cast out Abiathar, so that he would not be the priest of the Lord, so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke over the house of Eli at Shiloh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned aside after Adonijah, and he had not turned aside after Solomon. And so, Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and he took hold of the horn of the altar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And it was reported to king Solomon that Joab had fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and that he was beside the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, &#8220;Go, put him to death.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the Lord, and he said to him: &#8220;The king says this: &#8216;Come out.&#8217; &#8221; But he said: &#8220;I will not come out. Instead, I will die here.&#8221; Benaiah sent word back to the king, saying, &#8220;Joab said this, and he responded to me in this way.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And the king said to him, &#8220;Do just as he has said. And put him to death, and bury him. And so shall you take away the innocent blood, which was shed by Joab, from me and from my father&#8217;s house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And the Lord shall repay his blood upon his own head. For he killed two men, just and better than himself, and he killed them with the sword, while my father, David, did not know it: Abner, the son of Ner, leader of the military of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, leader of the army of Judah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And their blood shall be turned back upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his offspring forever. But as for David, and his offspring and house, and his throne, may there be peace from the Lord, even unto eternity.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And so Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and, attacking him, put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the desert.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And the king appointed Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the army. And he appointed Zadok, the priest, in place of Abiathar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>Also, the king sent for and summoned Shimei, and he said to him: &#8220;Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem, and live there. And do not depart from that place to here or to there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>For on whatever day you will have departed and crossed the torrent Kidron, know that you shall be put to death. Your blood will be upon your own head.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And Shimei said to the king: &#8220;The word is good. Just as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.&#8221; And so Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>But it happened that, after three years, the servants of Shimei fled to Achish, the son of Maacah, the king of Gath. And it was reported to Shimei that his servants had gone away to Gath.</content>

    <verse num="40">
      <content>And Shimei rose up, and he saddled his donkey. And went away to Achish in Gath, in order to seek his servants. And he led them away from Gath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And it was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone away from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And sending, he summoned him, and he said to him: &#8220;Did I not testify to you by the Lord, and warn you in advance, &#8216;On whatever day, having departed, you go forth to here or to there, know that you shall die?&#8217; And you responded to me, &#8216;The word that I have heard is good.&#8217;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>Then why have you not kept the oath to the Lord, and the commandment which I instructed to you?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>And the king said to Shimei: &#8220;You know all the evil, of which your heart is conscious, which you did to David, my father. The Lord has repaid your wickedness upon your own head.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And so the kingdom was confirmed in the hand of Solomon, and he was joined with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, by affinity.

    <verse num="4">
      <content>And so, he went away to Gibeon, so that he might immolate there; for that was the greatest high place. Solomon offered upon that altar, at Gibeon, one thousand victims as holocausts.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then the Lord appeared to Solomon, through a dream in the night, saying, &#8220;Request whatever you wish, so that I may give it to you.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And Solomon said: &#8220;You have shown great mercy to your servant David, my father, because he walked in your sight in truth and justice, and with an upright heart before you.

      <content>And your servant is in the midst of the people that you have chosen, an immense people, who are not able to be numbered or counted because of their multitude.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Therefore, give to your servant a teachable heart, so that he may be able to judge your people, and to discern between good and evil. For who will be able to judge this people, your people, who are so many?&#8221;</content>

      <content>And the Lord said to Solomon: &#8220;Since you have requested this word, and you have not asked for many days or for wealth for yourself, nor for the lives of your enemies, but instead you have requested for yourself wisdom in order to discern judgment:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>behold, I have done for you according to your words, and I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so much so that there has been no one like you before you, nor anyone who will rise up after you.</content>

      <content>And when the king had passed by, he cried out to the king, and he said: &#8220;Your servant went out to do battle in close quarters. And when one man had fled, a certain person brought him to me, and he said: &#8216;Guard this man. For if he slips away, your life will take the place of his life, or you will weigh out one talent of silver.&#8217;</content>

    <verse num="40">
      <content>And while I was distracted, turning one way and another, suddenly, he was not to be seen.&#8221; And the king of Israel said to him, &#8220;This is your judgment, that which you yourself have decreed.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Then immediately, he wiped away the dust from his face, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.</content>

    <verse num="42">
      <content>And he said to him: &#8220;Thus says the Lord: Because you have released from your hand a man worthy of death, your life will take the place of his life, and your people will take the place of his people.&#8221;</content>

      <content> The king of Samaria was girded for battle, meaning that he had not yet won the war. After the war is over, the victors would take off their weapons, and would then be ungirded. So this verse is saying that someone who had not yet won should not boast the same as someone who has won.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>And after these things, in that time, there was a vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, who was in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab, the king of Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Therefore, Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying: &#8220;Give your vineyard to me, so that I may make for myself a garden of herbs. For it is nearby and is beside my house. And I will give to you, in place of it, a better vineyard. Or if you consider it to be more convenient for you, I will give you the price in silver, whatever it is worth.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Naboth responded to him, &#8220;May the Lord be gracious to me, lest I give to you the inheritance of my fathers.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then Ahab went into his house, angry and gnashing his teeth over the word that Naboth, the Jezreelite, had spoken to him, saying, &#8220;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&#8221; And casting himself on his bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and he would not eat bread.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then Jezebel, his wife, entered to him, and she said to him: &#8220;What is this matter, by which your soul has been saddened? And why do you not eat bread?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And he responded to her: &#8220;I spoke to Naboth, the Jezreelite, and I said to him: &#8216;Give your vineyard to me, and accept money. Or if it pleases you, I will give to you a better vineyard, in place of it.&#8217; And he said, &#8216;I will not give my vineyard to you.&#8217; &#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Then Jezebel, his wife, said to him: &#8220;You are of great authority, and you rule well in the kingdom of Israel. Rise up and eat bread, and be even-tempered. I will give the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, to you.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And so, she wrote letters in the name of Ahab, and she sealed these with his ring. And she sent to those greater by birth, and to the nobles who were in his city and living with Naboth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And this was the judgment of the letters: &#8220;Proclaim a fast, and cause Naboth to sit among the first rulers of the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And send out two men, sons of Belial, against him. And let them speak the false testimony: &#8216;He has blasphemed God and king.&#8217; And then lead him away, and stone him, and so let him die.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then his fellow citizens, those greater by birth and the nobles who were living with him in the city, did just as Jezebel had instructed them, and just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>They proclaimed a fast, and they caused Naboth to sit among the first rulers of the people.</content>

      <content>And bringing forward two men, sons of the devil, they caused them to sit opposite him. And they, acting indeed like diabolical men, spoke testimony against him before the multitude: &#8220;Naboth has blasphemed God and king.&#8221; For this reason, they led him away, beyond the city, and they put him to death by stoning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And they sent to Jezebel, saying, &#8220;Naboth has been stoned, and he has died.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Then it happened that, when Jezebel had heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab: &#8220;Rise up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, who was not willing to acquiesce to you, and to give it to you in exchange for money. For Naboth is not alive, but dead.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And when Ahab had heard this, namely, that Naboth was dead, he rose up and descended to the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, so that he might take possession of it.</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>And you shall speak to him, saying: &#8216;Thus says the Lord: You have killed.

    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Ahab said to Elijah, &#8220;Have you discovered me to be your enemy?&#8221; And he said: &#8220;I have discovered you to have been sold, so that you would do evil in the sight of the Lord:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">

      <content>Then three years passed without war between Syria and Israel.</content>

      <content>But in the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, descended to the king of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And the king of Israel said to his servants, &#8220;Are you ignorant that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and that we have neglected to take it from the hand of the king of Syria?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And so he said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Will you come to the battle with me at Ramoth Gilead?&#8221;</content>

      <content>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: &#8220;As I am, so also are you. My people and your people are one. And my horsemen are your horsemen.&#8221; And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &#8220;I beg you to inquire today of the word of the Lord.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Therefore, the king of Israel gathered together the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them, &#8220;Should I go to Ramoth Gilead to make war, or should I be at peace?&#8221; They responded, &#8220;Ascend, and the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Then Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Is there not here a particular prophet of the Lord, so that we may inquire by him?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: &#8220;One man remains, by whom we may be able to inquire of the Lord: Micaiah, the son of Imlah. But I hate him. For he does not prophecy good to me, but evil.&#8221; And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;You should not speak in this way, O king.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Therefore, the king of Israel called a certain eunuch, and he said to him, &#8220;Hurry to bring here Micaiah, the son of Imlah.&#8221;</content>

      <content>Now the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were each sitting upon his own throne, clothed in the habit of royal vestments, in a courtyard beside the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying in their sight.</content>

      <content>Also, Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made for himself horns of iron, and he said, &#8220;Thus says the Lord: With these, you shall threaten Syria, until you destroy it.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then truly, the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying: &#8220;Behold, the words of the prophets, as if with one mouth, are predicting good to the king. Therefore, let your word be like theirs, and speak what is good.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>And the Lord said, &#8216;Who will mislead Ahab, the king of Israel, so that he may ascend and fall at Ramoth Gilead?&#8217; And one spoke words in this manner, and another spoke otherwise.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>So now, behold: the Lord has given a lying spirit into the mouth of all your prophets who are here. And the Lord has spoken evil against you.&#8221;</content>

      <content>Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, drew near and struck Micaiah on the jaw, and he said, &#8220;So then, has the Spirit of the Lord left me, and spoken to you?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And Micaiah said, &#8220;You shall see in the day when you will enter into a room within a room, so that you may conceal yourself.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And the king of Israel said: &#8220;Take Micaiah, and let him dwell with Amon, the ruler of the city, and with Joash, the son of Amalech.</content>

      <content>And tell them: &#8216;Thus says the king: Put this man in prison, and sustain him with the bread of affliction, and with the water of distress, until I return in peace.&#8217; &#8221;</content>
