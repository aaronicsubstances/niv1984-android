      <content>Also, the altar of brass, which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had constructed, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord. And so Solomon sought it, with the entire assembly.</content>

      <content>Then God said to Solomon: &#8220;Since this is the choice that pleased your heart, and you did not request wealth and substance and glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even many days of life, since instead you requested wisdom and knowledge so that you may be able to judge my people, over whom I have appointed you as king:</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he accomplished good in the sight of the Lord. Yet truly, not with a perfect heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And when he saw himself to be strengthened in his rule, he cut the throats of the servants who had killed his father, the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But he did not put to death their sons, just as it was written in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord instructed, saying: &#8220;The fathers shall not be slain because of the sons, nor the sons because of their fathers. Instead, each one shall die for his own sin.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And then Amaziah gathered together Judah, and he organized them by families, and tribunes, and centurions, throughout all of Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and upward. And he found three hundred thousand young men, who could go forth to battle, and who could hold spear and shield.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Also, he hired for pay from Israel one hundred thousand experienced men, for one hundred talents of silver.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>Then a man of God came to him, and he said: &#8220;O king, let not the army of Israel go forth with you. For the Lord is not with Israel, nor with all the sons of Ephraim.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But if you think that a war stands by the strength of the army, God will cause you to be overwhelmed by the enemies. For indeed, it belongs to God to assist, and to put to flight.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And Amaziah said to the man of God, &#8220;Then what will become of the one hundred talents, which I gave to the soldiers of Israel?&#8221; And the man of God responded to him, &#8220;The Lord has that from which he is able to give much more than this to you.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And so, Amaziah separated the army, which had come to him from Ephraim, so that they would return to their place. But having become very angry against Judah, they returned to their own region.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then Amaziah confidently led forth his people. And he went away to the Valley of the Salt Pits, and he struck down ten thousand of the sons of Seir.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And the sons of Judah captured another ten thousand of the men. And they led them to the precipice of a certain rock. And they threw them from the summit, and they were all broken apart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But the army that Amaziah had sent away, so that they would not go with him into battle, spread out among the cities of Judah, from Samaria as far as Beth-horon. And having killed three thousand, they took away much plunder.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Truly, after the slaughter of the Edomites, and when the gods of the sons of Seir were brought, Amaziah chose them as gods for himself. And he was adoring them, and burning incense to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For this reason, the Lord became angry against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who would say to him, &#8220;Why have you adored gods who did not free their own people from your hand?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And after he spoke these things, he responded to him: &#8220;Are you the counselor of the king? Be quiet! Otherwise I will put you to death.&#8221; And departing, the prophet said, &#8220;I know that God has decided to kill you, because you have done this evil, and also because you have not agreed to my counsel.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And so Amaziah, the king of Judah, undertaking a very wicked counsel, sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying: &#8220;Come, let us see one another.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But he sent back messengers, saying: &#8220;The thistle which is in Lebanon sent to the cedar of Lebanon, saying: &#8216;Give your daughter to my son as wife.&#8217; And behold, the beasts that were in the forest of Lebanon passed through, and they trampled the thistle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>You said, &#8216;I struck down Edom.&#8217; And for this reason, your heart is lifted up with pride. Settle in your own house. Why do you provoke evil against yourself, so that you may fall, and then Judah with you?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Amaziah was not willing to listen to him, because it was the will of the Lord that he be delivered into the hands of the enemies, because of the gods of Edom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And so Joash, the king of Israel, ascended, and they presented themselves within the sight of one another. Now Amaziah, the king of Judah, was in Beth-shemesh of Judah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And Judah fell before Israel. And each one fled to his own tent.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Then Joash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and he led him to Jerusalem. And he destroyed its walls, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Also, he brought back to Samaria all the gold and silver, and all the vessels, which he had found in the house of God, and with Obededom in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house, as well as sons for hostages.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Then Amaziah, the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Now the rest of the words of Amaziah, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And after he withdrew from the Lord, they set up an ambush against him in Jerusalem. But since he had fled into Lachish, they sent and killed him in that place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And having carried him back upon horses, they buried him with his fathers in the City of David.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then all the people of Judah appointed his son, Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, as king in place of his father, Amaziah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>He built up Eloth, and he restored it to the dominion of Judah. After this, the king slept with his fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Uzziah was sixteen years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Amaziah, had done.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And he sought the Lord, during the days of Zechariah, who understood and saw God. And while he was seeking the Lord, he directed him in all things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Indeed, he went out and fought against the Philistines. And he destroyed the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. Also, he built towns in Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians, who were living in Gurbaal, and against the Ammonites.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the Ammonites weighed out gifts to Uzziah. And his name became widely known, even to the entrance of Egypt, because of his frequent victories.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, above the gate of the corner, and above the gate of the valley, and others on the same side of the wall, and he fortified them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Then he also constructed towers in the wilderness, and dug many cisterns, because he had much cattle, both in the plains and in the starkness of the wilderness. Also, he had vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains and at Carmel. Certainly, he was a man devoted to agriculture.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now the army of his warriors, who would go forth to battle, was under the hand of Jeiel, the scribe, and Maaseiah, the teacher, and under the hand of Hananiah, who was among the king&#8217;s commanders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And the entire number of the leaders, by the families of strong men, was two thousand six hundred.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the entire army under them was three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, who were fit for war, and who fought on behalf of the king against the adversaries.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Also, Uzziah prepared for them, that is, for the entire army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, as well as slings for the casting of stones.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And in Jerusalem, he made various kinds of machines, which he placed in the towers, and at the corners of the walls, so as to shoot arrows and large stones. And his name went forth to far away places, for the Lord was helping him and had strengthened him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up, even to his own destruction. And he neglected the Lord his God. And entering into the temple of the Lord, he intended to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And entering immediately after him, Azariah the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, very valiant men,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>withstood the king, and they said: &#8220;It is not your office, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord; rather, it is the office of the priests, that is, of the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated for this same ministry. Depart from the sanctuary, otherwise you will be in contempt. For this act will not be reputed to you for your glory by the Lord God.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Uzziah, having become angry, while holding in his hand the censer so that he might burn incense, threatened the priests. And immediately a leprosy arose on his forehead, in the sight of the priests, in the house of the Lord, at the altar of incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And when the high priest Azariah, and all the rest of the priests, had gazed upon him, they saw the leprosy on his forehead, and they hurried to expel him. Then too, he himself, becoming terrified, rushed to depart, because immediately he had become aware of the wound of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And so, king Uzziah was a leper, even until the day of his death. And he lived in a separate house, being full of leprosy, because of which he had been ejected from the house of the Lord. Then Jotham, his son, directed the house of the king, and he was judging the people of the land.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But the rest of the words of Uzziah, the first and the last, were written by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And Uzziah slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchers, because he was a leper. And Jotham, his son, reigned in his place.</content>

      <content>Jotham was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he did what was right before the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Uzziah, had done, except that he did not enter into the temple of the Lord, and still the people were transgressing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>He improved the high gate of the house of the Lord. And he built many things upon the wall of Ophel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Also, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and fortresses and towers in the forests.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>He fought against the king of the sons of Ammon, and he defeated them. And at that time, the sons of Ammon gave to him one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cor of wheat, and the same number of cor of barley. These things the sons of Ammon offered to him in the second and third year.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Ahaz was twenty years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what is right in the sight of the Lord, as his father David did.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. Moreover, he also cast statues for the Baals.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>It is he who burned incense in the Valley of the son of Hinnom. And he purified his sons by fire, in accord with the ritual of the nations that the Lord put to death at the advent of the sons of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Also, he was sacrificing and burning incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And so the Lord, his God, delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, who struck him and took great plunder from his kingdom. And he carried it away to Damascus. Also, he was delivered into the hands of the king of Israel, and he struck him with great affliction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed, on one day, one hundred twenty thousand, all of them men of war from Judah, because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>In the same time, Zichri, a powerful man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the son of the king, and Azrikam, the governor of his house, and also Elkanah, who was second to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the sons of Israel seized, from their brothers, two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls, and immense plunder. And they took it away to Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>At that time, there was a prophet of the Lord there, named Oded. And going out to meet the army arriving in Samaria, he said to them: &#8220;Behold, the Lord, the God of your fathers, having become angry against Judah, has delivered them into your hands. But you have killed them by atrocities, so that your cruelty has reached up to heaven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Moreover, you wanted to subjugate the sons of Judah and Jerusalem as your men and women servants, which is a work that should never be done. And so you sinned in this matter against the Lord your God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But listen to my counsel, and release the captives, whom you have brought from your brothers. For a great fury of the Lord is hanging over you.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And so, some of the leaders of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa, the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were arriving from the battle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And they said to them: &#8220;You shall not lead back captives to here, lest we sin against the Lord. Why are you willing to add to our sins, and to build upon our old offenses? For indeed, the sin is great, and the furious anger of the Lord is hanging over Israel.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And the warriors released the spoils and all that they had seized, in the sight of the leaders and the entire multitude.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives. All those who were naked, they clothed from the spoils. And when they had clothed them, and had given them shoes, and had refreshed them with food and drink, and had anointed them because of the hardship, and had cared for them, whoever was not able to walk and whoever was feeble in body, they set them upon beasts of burden, and they led them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers, and they themselves returned to Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>In that time, king Ahaz sent to the king of the Assyrians, requesting assistance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And the Edomites arrived and struck down many of Judah, and they seized great plunder.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Also, the Philistines spread out among the cities of the plains, and to the south of Judah. And they seized Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and also Soco, and Timnah, and Gimzo, with their villages, and they lived in them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For the Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz, the king of Judah, since he had stripped it of help, and had shown contempt for the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And he led against him Tilgath-pilneser, the king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him and laid waste to him, without resistance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And so Ahaz, despoiling the house of the Lord, and the house of the kings and the leaders, gave gifts to the king of the Assyrians, and yet it profited him nothing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Moreover, in the time of his anguish, he also added to his contempt against the Lord. King Ahaz himself, by himself,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>immolated victims to the gods of Damascus, those who had struck him. And he said: &#8220;The gods of the kings of Syria assist them, and so I will please them with victims, and they will help me.&#8221; But to the contrary, they had been the ruin of him and of all Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And so, Ahaz, having despoiled and broken apart all the vessels of the house of God, closed up the doors of the temple of God, and made for himself altars in all the corners of Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Also, he constructed altars in all the cities of Judah, in order to burn frankincense, and so he provoked the Lord, the God of his fathers, to wrath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But the rest of his words, and all his works, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And Ahaz slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the city of Jerusalem. And they did not allow him to be in the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And his son, Hezekiah, reigned in his place.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="29" preferred_title="2 Chronicles 29">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And so Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, in accord with all that his father David had done.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>In the first year and month of his reign, he opened the double doors of the house of the Lord, and he repaired them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And he brought together the priests and Levites. And he gathered them in the wide eastern street.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And he said to them: &#8220;Listen to me, O Levites, and be sanctified. Cleanse the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away every uncleanness from the sanctuary.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Our fathers sinned and did evil in the sight of the Lord our God, abandoning him. They turned their faces away from the tabernacle of the Lord, and they presented their backs.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>They closed up the doors which were in the portico, and they extinguished the lamps. And they did not burn incense, and they did not offer holocausts, in the sanctuary of the God of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And so the fury of the Lord was stirred up against Judah and Jerusalem, and he handed them over to turmoil, and to destruction, and to hissing, just as you discern with your own eyes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword. Our sons, and our daughters and wives have been led away as captives because of this wickedness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now therefore, it is pleasing to me that we should enter into a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel. And he will turn away the fury of his indignation from us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>My sons, do not choose to be negligent. The Lord has chosen you so that you would stand before him, and minister to him, and worship him, and burn incense to him.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Therefore, the Levites rose up, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel, the son of Azariah, from the sons of Kohath; then, from the sons of Merari, Kish, the son of Abdi, and Azariah, the son of Jehallelel; and from the sons of Gershon, Joah, the son of Zimmah, and Eden, the son of Joah;</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And they gathered together their brothers. And they were sanctified. And they entered in accord with the command of the king and the order of the Lord, so that they might expiate the house of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the priests, entering the temple of the Lord so that they might sanctify it, took every uncleanness, which they had found inside, out to the vestibule of the house of the Lord; and the Levites took it away and transported it outside, to the torrent Kidron.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month. And on the eighth day of the same month, they entered the portico of the temple of the Lord. And then they expiated the temple over eight days. And on the sixteenth day of the same month, they finished what they had begun.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">

      <content> The ancient Jewish burial custom was to bury the dead, and then, about a year or so later, to dig up the bones of the dead and keep them in an ossuary (a bone box).
