    <verse num="1">
      <content>In the first year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of the Persians, so that the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah would be fulfilled. And he sent out a voice, throughout his entire kingdom, and also in writing, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>&#8220;Thus says Cyrus, the king of the Persians: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me, and he himself has instructed me that I should build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>Who among you is from his entire people? May his God be with him. Let him ascend to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and let him build the house of the Lord, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem.</content>

      <content>And let all who remain, in all the places wherever they may live, assist him, each man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods and cattle, in addition to whatever they may offer voluntarily to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem.&#8221;</content>

      <content>And the leaders of the fathers from Judah and from Benjamin, with the priests, and the Levites, and all those whose spirit was stirred by God, rose up, so that they might ascend to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.</content>

      <content>And all those who were all around assisted their hands with vessels of silver and gold, with goods and cattle, with equipment, in addition to whatever they had offered freely.</content>

      <content>Likewise, king Cyrus offered the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Now Cyrus, king of Persia, offered these by the hand of Mithredath, the son of the treasurer, and he counted these out to Sheshbazzar, the leader of Judah.</content>

    <note num="1">
      <content> Taking foreign wives was offensive, not because of their ancestry, but because of the absence among them of the Jewish faith. Even in ancient times, the Law permitted persons of non-Hebrew ancestry to join with the Israelites, to accept the Jewish faith, and to be treated as Jews under the Law. So the wives were foreign in the sense that they were non-Jews, not because they were non-Hebrews. For an example of a non-Hebrew wife acceptable to the Jews, see the book of Ruth.</content>
