      <content>And they said to me: &#8220;Those who have remained and have been left behind from the captivity, there in the province, are in great affliction and in disgrace. And the wall of Jerusalem has been broken apart, and its gates have been burned with fire.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>may your ears be attentive, and may your eyes be open, so that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I am praying before you today, night and day, for the sons of Israel, your servants.

      <content>But if you will return to me, and keep my precepts, and do them, even if you will have been led away to the furthest reaches of the heavens, I will gather you from there, and I will lead you back to the place that I have chosen so that my name would dwell there.&#8217;</content>

      <content>But Sanballat, a Horonite, and the servant Tobiah, an Ammonite, and Geshem, an Arab, heard of it. And they ridiculed and disparaged us, and they said: &#8220;What is this thing that you are doing? Could you be rebelling against the king?&#8221;</content>

      <content> Why is this line attributed to two men, Jeshua and Joab? One possibility is that one man died with no children, or at least no sons, and his brother, in accord with Mosaic Law, married his widow in order to raise up sons to his brother. So the sons of the second husband of the woman would be attributed to the lineage of both men. This Biblical principle, that biological descent is not necessary for a lineage, is also found in Matthew&#8217;s Gospel, where he recounts the lineage of Joseph, even though Jesus is not the biological son of Joseph.</content>

      <content>Then he made for himself a large storeroom, and in that place, there was laid before him gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the gatekeepers, and the first-fruits of the priests.</content>

      <content>In those days, I saw, in Judah, some who were treading the presses on the Sabbath, and who were carrying sheaves, and placing on donkeys burdens of wine, and of grapes, and of figs, and all manner of burdens, and who were bringing these into Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I contended with them, so that they would sell on a day when it was permitted to sell.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>And some Tyrians dwelt within, who were bringing fish and all kinds of items for sale. And they were selling on the Sabbaths to the sons of Judah in Jerusalem.</content>

      <content>And I put the nobles of Judah under oath, and I said to them: &#8220;What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Did not our fathers do these things, and so our God brought all this evil upon us and upon this city? And you are adding more wrath upon Israel by violating the Sabbath!&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>And it happened that, when the gates of Jerusalem had rested on the day of the Sabbath, I spoke, and they closed the gates. And I instructed that they should not open them until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my servants over the gates, so that no one would carry in a burden on the day of the Sabbath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And so the merchants and those who sold all kinds of items remained just outside of Jerusalem, once and again.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And I contended with them, and I said to them: &#8220;Why are you remaining just beyond the wall? If you do this again, I will send hands upon you.&#8221; And so, from that time, they no longer came on the Sabbath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>I also spoke to the Levites, so that they would be cleansed, and would arrive to guard the gates and to sanctify the day of the Sabbath. Because of this also, O my God, remember me and spare me, in accord with the multitude of your mercies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But also in those days, I saw some Jews taking wives from the Ashdodites, and the Ammonites, and the Moabites.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And their sons spoke partly in the speech of Ashdod, and they did not know how to speak the Jewish language, and they were speaking according to the language of one people or another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And I put them under oath, and I cursed them. And I struck some of their men, and I shaved off their hair, and I made them swear to God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>&#8220;Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin in this kind of thing? And certainly, among many nations, there was no king similar to him, and he was beloved of his God, and God set him as king over all of Israel. And yet foreign women led even him into sin!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>So how could we disobey and do all this great evil, so that we would transgress against our God, and take foreign wives?&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="28">
      <content>Now one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the high priest, was a son-in-law to Sanballat, a Horonite, and I made him flee from me.</content>
