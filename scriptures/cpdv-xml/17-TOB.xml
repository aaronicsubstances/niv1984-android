      <content>Although he had been taken captive in the days of Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, even in such a situation as captivity, he did not desert the way of truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>So then, every day, all that he was able to obtain, he bestowed on his fellow captive brothers, who were from his kindred.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And, when he was among the youngest of any in the tribe of Naphtali, he showed not so much as any childish behavior in his work.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>And then, when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam, king of Israel, had made, he alone fled from the company of them all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Yet he continued on to Jerusalem, to the temple of the Lord, and there he adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his first-fruits and his tithes.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>So then, in the third year, he administered all his tithes to new converts and to new arrivals.</content>

      <content>From his infancy, he taught him to fear God and to abstain from all sin.</content>

      <content>Therefore, when, during the captivity, he had arrived with his wife and son at the city of Nineveh, with all his tribe,</content>

      <content>Every day, Tobit traveled through all his own people, and he consoled them, and he distributed to each one as much as he could from his resources.</content>

      <content>He nourished the hungry, and he supplied clothes to the naked, and he showed concern for the burial of the dead and of the slain.</content>

      <content>And then, when king Sennacherib had returned from Judea, fleeing the scourge which God had caused all around him because of his blasphemy, and, being angry, he was slaughtering many from the sons of Israel, Tobit buried their bodies.</content>

    <verse num="22">
      <content>And when it was reported to the king, he ordered him to be slain, and he took away all his belongings.</content>

      <content> The Latin text plainly says that Sephet is on the &#8216;left,&#8217; but the Challoner and the Douay-Rheims versions have this as on the &#8216;right.&#8217; The Wycliffe version has it as &#8216;the left.&#8217;</content>

      <content> In this context, the new arrivals would refer not merely to any stranger or foreigner, but to those who were a new arrival to Jerusalem, who were there to inquire about the Jewish faith. And the new converts would be those one step further in the process of becoming a Jew. The word &#8216;ministraret&#8217; indicates that Tobit did not merely give away his tithes, but he applied them judiciously to particular persons and circumstances, as needed.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content> Since Tobit and his son have the same name, editors of various Bible editions have introduced variations on the name, so as to distinguish between the father and his son. In this translation, the father is called &#8216;Tobit,&#8217; and his son is called, &#8216;Tobias.&#8217; But actually, they have the same name.</content>

    <note num="4">
      <content> The word &#8216;nudus&#8217; in this context does not mean that Tobit was naked, but that he fled with nothing of his possessions, but only with his wife and son.</content>

      <content>he said to his son: &#8220;Go, and bring some others who fear God from our tribe to feast with us.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And after he had gone, returning, he reported to him that one of the sons of Israel, with his throat cut, was lying in the street. And immediately, he leapt from his place reclining at table, left behind his dinner, and went forth with fasting to the body.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And taking it up, he carried it in secret to his house, so that, after the sun had set, he might bury him cautiously.</content>

      <content>And after he had hidden the body, he chewed his bread with mourning and fear,</content>

      <content>remembering the word that the Lord spoke through the prophet Amos: &#8220;Your feast days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.&#8221;</content>

      <content>Truly, when the sun had set, he went out, and he buried him.</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>Yet all his neighbors argued with him, saying: &#8220;Now, an order was given to execute you because of this matter, and you barely escaped a death sentence, and again you are burying the dead?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But Tobit, fearing God more than the king, stole away the bodies of the slain and concealed them in his house, and in the middle of the night, he buried them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But it happened one day, being tired from burying the dead, he came into his house, and he threw himself down next to the wall, and he slept.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And, as he was sleeping, warm droppings from a swallow&#8217;s nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And so the Lord permitted this trial to befall him, in order that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, which is even like that of holy Job.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For, even from his infancy, he had always feared God and kept his commandments, so he was not discouraged before God because of the scourge of blindness that had befallen him.</content>

      <content>But he remained immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.</content>

      <content>In truth, Tobit corrected them, saying: &#8220;Do not speak in this way,</content>

      <content>for we are the sons of the holy ones, and we look forward to that life which God will give to those who never change in their faith before him.&#8221;</content>

      <content>In truth, his wife Anna went out to weaving work daily, and she brought back the provisions that she was able to obtain by the labor of her hands.</content>

      <content>Whereupon it happened that, having received a young goat, she brought it home.</content>

    <verse num="21">
      <content>When her husband heard the sound of its bleating, he said, &#8220;Look, so that it might not be stolen, return it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat, or to touch, anything stolen.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>At this, his wife, being angry, answered, &#8220;Clearly, your hope has become vanity, and the manner of your almsgiving has become apparent.&#8221;</content>

      <content> In this context, parentes is more general than the English word &#8216;parents,&#8217; encompassing his parents, grandparents, and probably any older relatives of previous generations who would see Tobit as subordinate to them. The word &#8216;cognati&#8217; refers even more generally to people knew Tobit, such as friends and acquaintances. It can also be used as one word referring to both relatives and friends.</content>

      <content>Then Tobit sighed, and he began to pray with tears,</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>saying, &#8220;O Lord, you are just and all your judgments are just, and all your ways are mercy, and truth, and judgment.</content>

      <content>And now, O Lord, remember me, and do not take vengeance for my sins, and do not call to mind my offenses, nor those of my parents.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For we have not obeyed your precepts, and so we have been handed over to plundering and to captivity, and to death, and to mockery, and as a disgrace before all the nations, among which you have dispersed us.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>And now, O Lord, great are your judgments. For we have not acted according to your precepts, and we have not walked sincerely before you.</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>And now, O Lord, do with me according to your will, and order my spirit to be received in peace. For it is more expedient for me to die, than to live.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>And so, on the same day, it happened that Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in Rages, a city of the Medes, also heard a reproach from one of her father&#8217;s servant maids.</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>For she had been given to seven husbands, and a demon named Asmodeus had killed them, as soon as they had approached her.</content>

      <content>Therefore, when she corrected the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying, &#8220;May we never see son or daughter from you upon the earth, you murderess of your husbands.</content>

      <content>Would you also kill me, just as you have already killed seven husbands?&#8221; At these words, she proceeded to an upper room of her house. And for three days and three nights, she did not eat or drink.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;ludentibus&#8217; refers to playfulness or to playing games. Sara has not joined in with those who live for their own amusement. There may also be a sexual connotation to this first part of the verse. She has not treated male-female relationships as a source of amusement. The second part of the verse is similar in meaning to the first part.</content>

Azariah is a name meaning &#8216;Yahweh helps,&#8217; which is an apt description of Raphael. Hananiah is a name meaning &#8216;Yahweh is merciful,&#8217; which is an apt description of God himself. The Angels are sons of God. And he calls Hananiah &#8216;the great&#8217; because he is using that name to refer to God himself. God is great.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;palpitare&#8217; can refer to throbbing, beating, or pulsating; but in this context, it means that the fish was thrashing back and forth on the ground.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> This action of taking a fish and dividing it into parts is very similar to the various Old Testament animal sacrifices, which of course have a symbolic meaning. The term 'heart' is still used today in modern English as a symbol. Similarly, the parts of the fish have symbolic meanings. The smoke symbolizes prayer. The heart symbolizes a pure love for God and neighbor. The liver symbolizes the removal of sin from one's life (the liver removes toxins from the body). The gall symbolizes the suffering of self-denial and the healthful effects on the soul of that suffering (since gall is bitter, but was used as a medicine in ancient times). So the parts of the fish represent useful medicines for the soul.</content>

      <content>Do you think that Gabael has died, and that no one will repay him the money?&#8221;</content>

      <content>And so he began to be exceedingly sad, both he and his wife Anna with him. And they both began to weep together, because their son did not at least return to them on the appointed day.</content>

      <content>But his mother wept inconsolable tears, and also said: &#8220;Woe, woe to me, O my son. Why did we send you to journey far away, you: the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, the solace of our life, the hope of our posterity?</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>Yet she was by no means able to be consoled. But, leaping up every day, she looked all round, and traveled around all the ways, by which there seemed any hope that he might return, so that she might possibly see him coming from afar.</content>

      <content>In truth, Raguel said to his son-in-law, &#8220;Remain here, and I will send a message of your health to your father Tobit.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="9">

    </verse>

      <content>And when Raguel had repeatedly petitioned Tobias, and he was by no means willing to listen to him, he delivered Sarah to him, and half of all his substance: with men and women servants, with sheep, camels, and cows, and with much money.
