<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, called as an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God; and Sosthenes, a brother:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>to the Church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints with all who are invoking the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and of ours.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I give thanks to my God continuously for you because of the grace of God that has been given to you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>By that grace, in all things, you have become wealthy in him, in every word and in all knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And so, the testimony of Christ has been strengthened in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In this way, nothing is lacking to you in any grace, as you await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he, too, will strengthen you, even until the end, without guilt, until the day of the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>God is faithful. Through him, you have been called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And so, I beg you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that every one of you speak in the same way, and that there be no schisms among you. So may you become perfect, with the same mind and with the same judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For it has been indicated to me, about you, my brothers, by those who are with Chloes, that there are contentions among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now I say this because each of you is saying: “Certainly, I am of Paul;” “But I am of Apollo;” “Truly, I am of Cephas;” as well as: “I am of Christ.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I give thanks to God that I have baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>lest anyone say that you have been baptized in my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Other than these, I do not recall if I baptized any others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to evangelize: not through the wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ become empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the Word of the Cross is certainly foolishness to those who are perishing. But to those who have been saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For it has been written: “I will perish the wisdom of the wise, and I will reject the discernment of the prudent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Where are the wise? Where are the scribes? Where are the truth-seekers of this age? Has not God made the wisdom of this world into foolishness?</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For the world did not know God through wisdom, and so, in the wisdom of God, it pleased God to accomplish the salvation of believers, through the foolishness of our preaching.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For the Jews ask for signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But we are preaching Christ crucified. Certainly, to the Jews, this is a scandal, and to the Gentiles, this is foolishness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But to those who have been called, Jews as well as Greeks, the Christ is the virtue of God and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For what is foolishness to God is considered wise by men, and that which is weakness to God is considered strong by men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So take care of your vocation, brothers. For not many are wise according to the flesh, not many are powerful, not many are noble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But God has chosen the foolish of the world, so that he may confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak of the world, so that he may confound the strong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And God has chosen the ignoble and contemptible of the world, those who are nothing, so that he may reduce to nothing those who are something.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So then, nothing that is of the flesh should glory in his sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But you are of him in Christ Jesus, who was made by God to be our wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And so, in the same way, it was written: “Whoever glories, should glory in the Lord.”</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-34'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘conquisitor’ refers to those who search for something, and the prefix ‘con’ intensifies the meaning of the word, making it an intense search, and the context of the verse makes it a search for wisdom and truth. Hence the translation: truth-seekers.</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-35'>1 Corinthians 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so, brothers, when I came to you, announcing to you the testimony of Christ, I did not bring exalted words or lofty wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For I did not judge myself to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and with much trembling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And my words and preaching were not the persuasive words of human wisdom, but were a manifestation of the Spirit and of virtue,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>so that your faith would not be based on the wisdom of men, but on the virtue of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now, we do speak wisdom among the perfect, yet truly, this is not the wisdom of this age, nor that of the leaders of this age, which shall be reduced to nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Instead, we speak of the wisdom of God in a mystery which has been hidden, which God predestined before this age for our glory,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>something that none of the leaders of this world have known. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But this is just as it has been written: “The eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And who can know the things that are of a man, except the spirit which is within that man? So also, no one knows the things which are of God, except the Spirit of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But we have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit who is of God, so that we may understand the things that have been given to us by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And we are also speaking of these things, not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, bringing spiritual things together with spiritual things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But the animal nature of man does not perceive these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand it, because it must be examined spiritually.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But the spiritual nature of man judges all things, and he himself may be judged by no man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For who has known the mind of the Lord, so that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so, brothers, I was not able to speak to you as if to those who are spiritual, but rather as if to those who are carnal. For you are like infants in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food. For you were not yet able. And indeed, even now, you are not able; for you are still carnal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And since there is still envy and contention among you, are you not carnal, and are you not walking according to man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For if one says, “Certainly, I am of Paul,” while another says, “I am of Apollo,” are you not men? But what is Apollo, and what is Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>We are only the ministers of him in whom you have believed, just as the Lord has granted to each of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I planted, Apollo watered, but God provided the growth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so, neither he who plants, nor he who waters, is anything, but only God, who provides the growth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now he who plants, and he who waters, are one. But each shall receive his proper reward, according to his labors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For we are God’s assistants. You are God’s cultivation; you are God’s construction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>According to the grace of God, which has been given to me, I have laid the foundation like a wise architect. But another builds upon it. So then, let each one be careful how he builds upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For no one is able to lay any other foundation, in place of that which has been laid, which is Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But if anyone builds upon this foundation, whether gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>each one’s work shall be made manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it will be revealed by fire. And this fire will test each one’s work, as to what kind it is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>If anyone’s work, which he has built upon it, remains, then he will receive a reward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer its loss, but he himself will still be saved, but only as through fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Do you not know that you are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God lives within you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if anyone violates the Temple of God, God will destroy him. For the Temple of God is holy, and you are that Temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish, so that he may be truly wise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. And so it has been written: “I will catch the wise in their own astuteness.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And again: “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so, let no one glory in men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For all is yours: whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future. Yes, all is yours.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Accordingly, let man consider us to be ministers of Christ and attendants of the mysteries of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Here and now, it is required of attendants that each one be found to be faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But as for me, it is such a small thing to be judged by you, or by the age of mankind. And neither do I judge myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For I have nothing on my conscience. But I am not justified by this. For the Lord is the One who judges me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But, because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife, and a wife should also act similarly toward her husband.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But I am saying this, neither as an indulgence, nor as a commandment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For I would prefer it if you were all like myself. But each person has his proper gift from God: one in this way, yet another in that way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But I say to the unmarried and to widows: It is good for them, if they would remain as they are, just as I also am.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if they cannot restrain themselves, they should marry. For it is better to marry, than to be burned.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But to those who have been joined in matrimony, it is not I who commands you, but the Lord: a wife is not to separate from her husband.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-152'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But if she has separated from him, she must remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband should not divorce his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-153'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Concerning the rest, I am speaking, not the Lord. If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-156'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart. For a brother or sister cannot be made subject to servitude in this way. For God has called us to peace.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-163'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For any servant who has been called in the Lord is free in the Lord. Similarly, any free person who has been called is a servant in Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-165'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Brothers, let each one, in whatever state he was called, remain in that state with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-166'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord. But I give counsel, as one who has obtained the mercy of the Lord, so as to be faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-167'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Therefore, I consider this to be good, because of the present necessity: that it is good for a man to be such as I am.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-168'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be freed. Are you free of a wife? Do not seek a wife.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-170'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And so, this is what I say, brothers: The time is short. What remains of it is such that: those who have wives should be as if they had none;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-171'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>and those who weep, as though they were not weeping; and those who rejoice, as if they were not rejoicing; and those who buy, as if they possessed nothing;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>and those who use the things of this world, as if they were not using them. For the figure of this world is passing away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-173'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But I would prefer you to be without worry. Whoever is without a wife is worried about the things of the Lord, as to how he may please God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-174'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But whoever is with a wife is worried about the things of the world, as to how he may please his wife. And so, he is divided.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-175'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And the unmarried woman and the virgin think about the things that are of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and in spirit. But she who is married thinks about the things that are of the world, as to how she may please her husband.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-176'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Furthermore, I am saying this for your own benefit, not in order to cast a snare over you, but toward whatever is honest and whatever may provide you with the ability to be without hindrance, so as to worship the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-177'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>But if any man considers himself to seem dishonorable, concerning a virgin who is of adult age, and so it ought to be, he may do as he wills. If he marries her, he does not sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-178'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>But if he has decided firmly in his heart, and he does not have any obligation, but only the power of his free will, and if he has judged this in his heart, to let her remain a virgin, he does well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-179'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And so, he who joins with his virgin in matrimony does well, and he who does not join with her does better.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-180'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>A woman is bound under the law for as long as her husband lives. But if her husband has died, she is free. She may marry whomever she wishes, but only in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-181'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>But she will be more blessed, if she remains in this state, in accord with my counsel. And I think that I, too, have the Spirit of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-185'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But if anyone considers himself to know anything, he does not yet know in the way that he ought to know.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-188'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For although there are things that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (if one even considers there to be many gods and many lords)</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-1' href='#cpdv-verse-11-1'>a</a>. <span> This passage does not use ‘vir’ or ‘viri’ to refer to ‘husband,’ but more generally to ‘man.’ This is clear because the same word ‘vir’ is used consistently, even when there is no marriage relationship at issue, e.g. ‘the head of every man is Christ.’ Not every man is a husband, so vir and viri in this context mean man, not husband.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-2' href='#cpdv-verse-11-2'>b</a>. <span> The veil or headcovering is a symbol if the order in creation, which includes Angels as well as men. For even among the Angels, there is order and levels of authority. The Angels are not all the same, they do not all have the same role, and some Angels have authority over other Angels. The holy Angels are offended when women pray without a headcovering, or when women take roles which God intends only for men. For the holy Angels keep to their proper places and are obedient to those Angels in authority over them. But the fallen angels rebelled by disobedience and by refusing to accept Christ as their head, as someone with authority over them; and so they destined themselves for Hell. Women who refuse to wear a veil, or who dress like a man, or who take a man’s role, are being disobedient to Christ and are disrespecting their head, repeating in miniature the same fault of disobedience and disrespect that caused some Angels to fall from grace. When the holy Angels see such disorder and disobedience by women towards their head, they remember the fall of the disobedient angels and they cringe.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-3' href='#cpdv-verse-11-3'>c</a>. <span> Men are reflections of God, having the role of headship within humanity; women are reflections of Creation, that is, of nature, because God is the head of nature, just as man is the head of woman. Thus nature is referred to as ‘herself’.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-4' href='#cpdv-verse-11-4'>d</a>. <span> So, if you cannot see the wisdom of this teaching, then Paul says to at least accept it because it is a custom in the Church of God; there should be no other custom.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-358'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but more so to prophesy. For he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless perhaps he interprets, so that the Church may receive edification.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But now, brothers, if I were to come to you speaking in tongues, how would it benefit you, unless instead I speak to you in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Even those things that are without a soul can make sounds, whether it is a wind or a stringed instrument.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So it is with you also, for unless you utter with the tongue in plain speech, how will it be known what is said? For then you would be speaking into the air.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-363'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Consider that there are so many different kinds of languages in this world, and yet none is without a voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, if I do not understand the nature of the voice, then I shall be like a foreigner to the one with whom I am speaking; and he who is speaking will be like a foreigner to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So it is with you also. And since you are zealous for what is spiritual, seek the edification of the Church, so that you may abound.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For this reason, too, whoever speaks in tongues, let him pray for the interpretation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So, if I pray in tongues, my spirit prays, but my mind is without fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>What is next? I should pray with the spirit, and also pray with the mind. I should sing psalms with the spirit, and also recite psalms with the mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Otherwise, if you have blessed only with the spirit, how can someone, in a state of ignorance, add an “Amen” to your blessing? For he does not know what you are saying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>In this case, certainly, you give thanks well, but the other person is not edified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>I thank my God that I speak in tongues for all of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But in the Church, I prefer to speak five words from my mind, so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in tongues.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Brothers, do not choose to have the minds of children. Instead, be free of malice like infants, but be mature in your minds.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-387'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And God is not of dissension, but of peace, just as I also teach in all the churches of the saints.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-397'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so I make known to you, brothers, the Gospel that I preached to you, which you also received, and on which you stand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-398'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>By the Gospel, too, you are being saved, if you hold to the understanding that I preached to you, lest you believe in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For I handed on to you, first of all, what I also received: that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-402'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Next he was seen by more than five hundred brothers at one time, many of whom remain, even to the present time, although some have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-403'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Next, he was seen by James, then by all the Apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-404'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And last of all, he was seen also by me, as if I were someone born at the wrong time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-405'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For I am the least of the Apostles. I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-407'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For whether it is I or they: so we preach, and so you have believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-408'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now if Christ is preached, that he rose again from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-436'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Also, there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But while the one, certainly, has the glory of heaven, the other has the glory of earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>One has the brightness of the sun, another the brightness of the moon, and another the brightness of the stars. For even star differs from star in brightness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-438'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>So it is also with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown in corruption shall rise to incorruption.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-440'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>What is sown with an animal body shall rise with a spiritual body. If there is an animal body, there is also a spiritual one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-441'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Just as it was written that the first man, Adam, was made with a living soul, so shall the last Adam be made with a spirit brought back to life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-442'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>So what is, at first, not spiritual, but animal, next becomes spiritual.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-443'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>The first man, being earthly, was of the earth; the second man, being heavenly, will be of heaven.</span></div>
