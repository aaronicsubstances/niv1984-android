<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1'>1 Kings 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now king David had become elderly, and he had many days in his lifetime. And though he was covered with clothes, he was not warmed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, his servants said to him: “Let us seek, for our lord the king, a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and warm him, and sleep in his bosom, and provide warmth for our lord the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And so they sought a beautiful young woman in all the parts of Israel. And they found Abishag, a Shunammite, and they led her to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now the girl was exceedingly beautiful. And she slept with the king, and she ministered to him. Yet truly, the king did not know her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, “I shall reign!” And he appointed for himself chariots and horsemen, with fifty men who would run before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Neither did his father chastise him at any time, saying, “Why have you done this?” Now he, too, was very beautiful, the second in birth, after Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he conferred with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar, the priest, who gave assistance to the side of Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Yet truly, Zadok, the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Shimei and Rei, and the mature men of the army of David were not with Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, having immolated rams and calves and every kind of fat cattle beside the Stone of the Serpent, which was in the vicinity of the fountain Rogel, summoned all his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But he did not summon Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, and all the mature men, and Solomon, his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so Nathan said to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon: “Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has begun to reign, and that our lord David is ignorant of this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now then, come, accept my counsel, and save your life and the life of your son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Go and enter to king David, and say to him: ‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to me, your handmaid, saying: “Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit on my throne?” Then why does Adonijah reign?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And while you are still speaking with the king there, I will enter after you, and I will complete your words.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so Bathsheba entered to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag, the Shunammite, was ministering to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Bathsheba bowed herself, and she reverenced the king. And the king said to her, “What do you wish?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And responding, she said: “My lord, you swore to your handmaid, by the Lord your God: ‘your son Solomon will reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And now behold, Adonijah reigns, while you, my lord the king, are ignorant of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He has slain oxen, and every kind of fattened cattle, and many rams. And he has summoned all the sons of the king, as well as Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the leader of the military. But Solomon, your servant, he did not summon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Truly now, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel look with favor upon you, that you may indicate to them who ought to sit upon your throne, my lord the king, after you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Otherwise, this will be: when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be as sinners.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, arrived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they announced to the king, saying, “Nathan, the prophet, is here.” And when he had entered in the sight of the king, and he had reverenced prone on the ground,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Nathan said: “My lord the king, did you say, ‘Let Adonijah reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For today, he descended, and he immolated oxen, and fattened cattle, and many rams. And he summoned all the sons of the king, and the leaders of the army, along with Abiathar, the priest. And they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘As king Adonijah lives.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But he did not summon me, your servant, and Zadok, the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon, your lowly servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Could this word have gone out from my lord the king, and could you not have revealed it to me, your servant, as to who would be seated upon the throne of my lord the king after him?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And king David responded, saying, “Summon to me Bathsheba.” And when she had entered before the king, and she had stood before him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>the king swore and said: “As the Lord lives, who has rescued my soul from all distress,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>just as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel, saying: ‘Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne in my place,’ so shall I do this day.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And Bathsheba, having lowered her face to the ground, reverenced the king, saying, “May my lord David live forever.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And king David said, “Summon to me Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada.” And when they had entered before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>he said to them: “Take with you the servants of your lord, and place my son Solomon upon my mule. And lead him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And let Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him in that place as the king over Israel. And you shall sound the trumpet, and you shall say, ‘As king Solomon lives.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And you shall ascend after him, and he shall arrive and shall sit upon my throne. And he himself shall reign in my place. And I will command that he be the ruler over Israel and over Judah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, responded to the king, saying: “Amen. So says the Lord, the God of my lord the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>In the same way that the Lord has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon. And may he make his throne more sublime than the throne of my lord, king David.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, descended, with Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites. And they placed Solomon on the mule of king David, and they led him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Zadok, the priest, took the horn of oil from the tabernacle, and he anointed Solomon. And they sounded the trumpet. And all the people said, “As king Solomon lives.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And the entire multitude ascended after him. And the people were playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy. And the earth resounded before the noise of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, and all who had been summoned by him, heard it. And now the feast had ended. Then, too, Joab, hearing the voice of the trumpet, said, “What is the meaning of this clamor from the tumultuous city?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived. And Adonijah said to him, “Enter, for you are a valiant man, and you report good news.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And Jonathan answered Adonijah: “By no means. For our lord king David has appointed Solomon as king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And he has sent with him Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites. And they have placed him on the mule of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, at Gihon. And they are ascending from there, rejoicing, and so the city resounds. This is the noise that you have heard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>But also, Solomon sits upon the throne of the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And the servants of the king, entering, have blessed our lord king David, saying: ‘May God amplify the name of Solomon above your name, and may he magnify his throne above your throne.’ And the king reverenced from his bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And he said: ‘Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who today has bestowed someone to sit upon my throne, while my eyes may see it.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Therefore, all those who had been summoned by Adonijah were terrified. And they all rose up, and each one went his own way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, fearing Solomon, rose up and went away. And he took hold of the horn of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And they reported to Solomon, saying: “Behold, Adonijah, fearing king Solomon, has taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: ‘May king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put to death his servant with the sword.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And Solomon said: “If he is a good man, not so much as one hair of his head shall fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he shall die.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Therefore, king Solomon sent and brought him from the altar. And entering, he reverenced king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, “Go to your own house.”</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-57'>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘robur’ can mean strong or robust, but it can also mean mature or experienced. So the veterans of the army, who were older and experienced in battle, were faithful to David, despite his decline in his ability to lead, because of old age. But perhaps the newer recruits were impetuous and supported the younger leader, Adonijah.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The people were now swearing their oaths by Solomon, indicating that he is the rightful king, “As king Solomon lives, I shall do this or that.”</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-58'>1 Kings 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the days of David had drawn near, so that he would die, and he instructed his son Solomon, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>“I am entering the way of all the earth. Be strengthened and be a good man.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And observe the care of the Lord your God, so that you walk in his ways, so that you care for his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, just as it is written in the law of Moses. So may you understand everything that you do, in any direction that you may turn yourself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So may the Lord confirm his words, which he has spoken about me, saying: ‘If your sons will guard their ways, and if they will walk before me in truth, with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from you a man on the throne of Israel.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also, you know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, has done to me, what he did to the two leaders of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether. He killed them, and so he shed the blood of war in peace time, and he set the bloodshed of battle on his belt, which was around his waist, and in his shoes, which were on his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, act according to your wisdom. And you shall not allow his gray head to be led away to death in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then, too, repay grace to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite. And you shall allow them to eat at your table. For they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom, your brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Also, you have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, the son of Benjamin, from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went away to the camp. And he descended to meet me when I crossed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, ‘I will not put you to death by the sword,’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>yet do not choose to treat him as if he were innocent. Since you are a wise man, you will know what to do with him. And you shall lead away his grey hair to death with blood.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And so, David slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now the days during which David reigned over Israel are forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, thirty-three in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Adonijah, the son of Haggith, entered to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said to him, “Is your entrance peaceful?” He responded, “It is peaceful.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he added, “My word is for you.” She said to him, “Speak.” And he said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>“You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all of Israel had preferred me for themselves as king. But the kingdom was transferred, and has become my brother’s. For it was appointed to him by the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now therefore, I beg of you one petition. May you not confound my face.” And she said to him, “Speak.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he said: “I beg that you may speak to king Solomon, for he is not able to refuse anything to you, so that he may give Abishag the Shunammite to me as wife.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Bathsheba said: “It is well. I will speak to the king on your behalf.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Bathsheba went to king Solomon, so that she might speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and he reverenced her, and he sat down upon his throne. And a throne was stationed for the mother of the king, and she sat at his right hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And she said to him: “I petition one small request from you. May you not confound my face.” And the king said to her: “Ask, my mother. For it is not right that I turn away your face.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah, your brother, as wife.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And king Solomon responded, and he said to his mother: “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Why not request the kingdom for him! For he is my older brother, and he has Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And so king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: “May God do these things to me, and may he add these other things! For Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And now, as the Lord lives, who has confirmed me and placed me upon the throne of my father David, and who, just as he said, has made a house for me: Adonijah shall be put to death this day.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who put him to death, and so he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Also, the king said to Abiathar, the priest: “Go into Anathoth, to your own land, for you are a man worthy of death. But I will not put you to death this day, since you carried the ark of the Lord God before David, my father, and since you have endured hardship in all the things, for which my father labored.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Therefore, Solomon cast out Abiathar, so that he would not be the priest of the Lord, so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke over the house of Eli at Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned aside after Adonijah, and he had not turned aside after Solomon. And so, Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and he took hold of the horn of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And it was reported to king Solomon that Joab had fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and that he was beside the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, put him to death.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the Lord, and he said to him: “The king says this: ‘Come out.’ ” But he said: “I will not come out. Instead, I will die here.” Benaiah sent word back to the king, saying, “Joab said this, and he responded to me in this way.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And the king said to him, “Do just as he has said. And put him to death, and bury him. And so shall you take away the innocent blood, which was shed by Joab, from me and from my father’s house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And the Lord shall repay his blood upon his own head. For he killed two men, just and better than himself, and he killed them with the sword, while my father, David, did not know it: Abner, the son of Ner, leader of the military of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, leader of the army of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And their blood shall be turned back upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his offspring forever. But as for David, and his offspring and house, and his throne, may there be peace from the Lord, even unto eternity.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And so Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and, attacking him, put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And the king appointed Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the army. And he appointed Zadok, the priest, in place of Abiathar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Also, the king sent for and summoned Shimei, and he said to him: “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem, and live there. And do not depart from that place to here or to there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>For on whatever day you will have departed and crossed the torrent Kidron, know that you shall be put to death. Your blood will be upon your own head.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Shimei said to the king: “The word is good. Just as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” And so Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But it happened that, after three years, the servants of Shimei fled to Achish, the son of Maacah, the king of Gath. And it was reported to Shimei that his servants had gone away to Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And Shimei rose up, and he saddled his donkey. And went away to Achish in Gath, in order to seek his servants. And he led them away from Gath.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so the kingdom was confirmed in the hand of Solomon, and he was joined with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, by affinity. For he took his daughter, and he led her into the city of David, until he completed building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But still the people immolated in the high places. For no temple had been built to the name of the Lord, even to that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David, his father, except that he immolated in the high places, and he burned incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And so, he went away to Gibeon, so that he might immolate there; for that was the greatest high place. Solomon offered upon that altar, at Gibeon, one thousand victims as holocausts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then the Lord appeared to Solomon, through a dream in the night, saying, “Request whatever you wish, so that I may give it to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Solomon said: “You have shown great mercy to your servant David, my father, because he walked in your sight in truth and justice, and with an upright heart before you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And now, O Lord God, you have caused your servant to reign in place of David, my father. But I am a small child, and I am ignorant of my entrance and departure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And your servant is in the midst of the people that you have chosen, an immense people, who are not able to be numbered or counted because of their multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, give to your servant a teachable heart, so that he may be able to judge your people, and to discern between good and evil.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the word was pleasing before the Lord, that Solomon had requested this kind of thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Solomon: “Since you have requested this word, and you have not asked for many days or for wealth for yourself, nor for the lives of your enemies, but instead you have requested for yourself wisdom in order to discern judgment:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>behold, I have done for you according to your words, and I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so much so that there has been no one like you before you, nor anyone who will rise up after you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But also the things for which you did not ask, I have given to you, namely wealth and glory, so that no one has been like you among the kings in the all days before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And if you will walk in my ways, and keep my precepts and my commandments, just as your father walked, I will lengthen your days.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Solomon awakened, and he understood that it was a dream. And when he had arrived in Jerusalem, he stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered holocausts and made victims of peace offerings, and he held a great feast for all his servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then two women harlots went to the king, and they stood before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And one of them said: “I beg you, my lord, I and this woman were living in one house, and I gave birth, with her in the room.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then, on the third day after I gave birth, she also gave birth. And we were together, with no other person with us in the house, only the two of us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then this woman’s son died in the night. For while sleeping, she smothered him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And when I had arisen in the morning, so that I might give milk to my son, he appeared to be dead.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the other woman responded: “It is not such as you say.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then said the king: “This one says, ‘My son is alive, and your son is dead.’ And the other responds, ‘No, instead your son is dead, but mine lives.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore the king said, “Bring a sword to me.” And when they had brought a sword before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>he said, “Divide the living infant in two parts, and give a half part to the one and a half part to the other.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But the woman, whose son was alive, said to the king, for her heart was moved concerning her son, “I beg you, my lord, give the living infant to her, and do not kill him.” To the contrary, the other said, “Let it be neither for me, nor for you, instead divide it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The king responded and said: “Give the living infant to this woman, and do not kill it. For she is his mother.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then all of Israel heard about the judgment that the king had judged, and they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to accomplish judgment.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he built the house from the forest of Lebanon: one hundred cubits in length, and fifty cubits in width, and thirty cubits in height, with four walkways between columns of cedar. For he had hewn the cedar trees into columns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And he clothed the entire vaulted room with panels of cedar. And it was supported by forty-five columns. Now one row held fifteen columns,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-239'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>each positioned opposite another,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and looking toward one another, with equal spacing between the columns. And above the columns there were square beams equal in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he made a portico of columns, fifty cubits in length and thirty cubits in width, and another portico, facing the greater portico, with columns and with crossbeams upon the columns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He also made the portico of the throne, in which is the tribunal. And he overlaid it with cedar wood, from the floor even to the summit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And in the midst of the portico, there was a small house, where he would sit in judgment, similar in workmanship.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>All was of precious stones, which had been sawed by a particular standard and measure, as much within as without, from the foundation even to the summit of the walls, and outside even to the great atrium.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-249'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram of Tyre,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-250'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>the son of a widowed woman, from the tribe of Naphtali, whose father was a Tyrian, an artisan in brass, and full of wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge in order to form every work of brass. And when he had gone to king Solomon, he wrought all his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-251'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he cast two columns of brass. Each column was eighteen cubits in height, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed both columns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-252'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Also, he made two heads of molten brass, which would be set upon the tops of the columns: one head was five cubits in height, and the other head was five cubits in height.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-253'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And there was something like a network of chains, woven together in a wonderful manner.

And there were two hundred of the pomegranates, in rows around the second head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-257'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And he stationed the two columns in the portico of the temple.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-258'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And above the tops of the columns, he set a work in the manner of lilies. And the work of the columns was perfected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-259'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>He also made a molten sea, of ten cubits from brim to brim, rounded on all sides. Its height was five cubits, and a thin rope of thirty cubits wrapped it all around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-260'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And a sculpted work under the brim encircled it for ten cubits going around the sea. There were two rows cast of striated sculptures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-261'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And it was standing upon twelve oxen, of which three were looking toward the north, and three toward the west, and three toward the south, and three toward the east.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-262'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the basin was the thickness of three twelfths. And its brim was like the brim of a chalice, or like the outturned petal of a lily. It contained two thousand baths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-263'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And he made ten bases of brass: each base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in width, and three cubits in height.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-264'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And the work itself of the bases was engraved; and there were sculptures between the junctures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-265'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And between the little crowns and the edges, there were lions, and oxen, and cherubim; and similarly in the junctures above. And under the lions and oxen were something like bands of brass hanging down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-266'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And each base had four wheels, with axels of brass. And at the four sides were something like little arms, under the cast basin, facing away from one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-267'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Also, the mouth of the interior of the basin was at the top of the head.

And the spaces between the columns were square, not round.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-268'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined to one another under the base. The height of one wheel held one cubit and a half.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-269'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Now these were the kind of wheels such as are often made for a chariot. And their axels, and spokes, and tires, and centers were all cast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-270'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And the four little arms, which were at each corner of a base, were cast and joined together as part of the base itself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-271'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And at the summit of the base, there was a round stand of one half cubit, fabricated so that the basin could be placed upon it, having its engravings, and various sculptures of its own.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-274'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>In this manner, he made ten bases with the same casting and measure, and very similar engravings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-275'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>He also made ten hand basins of brass. One hand basin contained four baths, and was of four cubits. And each basin he set upon a base, which is ten bases.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-282'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>and the cooking pots, and the trays, and the small hooks. All of the items that Hiram made for king Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of golden brass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-283'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>In the open regions near the Jordan, the king cast these, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zarethan.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-285'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And Solomon made all the furniture for the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the bread of the presence would be placed;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-352'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>Then the king, and all of Israel with him, immolated victims before the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-355'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then Solomon made, at that time, a celebratory festival, and all of Israel with him, a great multitude, from the entrance of Hamath to the river of Egypt, in the sight of the Lord our God, for seven days plus seven days, that is, fourteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>And on the eighth day, he dismissed the people.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>the Lord appeared to him a second time, just as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-361'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the Lord said to him: “I have heard your prayer and your petition, which you prayed before me.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if you and your sons, wandering, will have turned away, not following me, and not keeping my commandments and my ceremonies, which I have proposed to you, but instead you go away, and you serve strange gods and adore them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>then I will take away Israel from the face of the land, which I have given to them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And this house will become an example: anyone who passes by it will be stupefied, and he will hiss and say, ‘Why has the Lord acted in this way to this land and to this house?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And they will respond: ‘Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who led their fathers away from the land of Egypt, and they followed strange gods, and they adored them and served them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then, when twenty years were fulfilled, after Solomon had built the two houses, that is, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Hiram, the king of Tyre, having supplied Solomon with cedar wood, and spruce wood, and gold, in accord with all that he needed, then Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he said, “Are these the cities that you have given to me, brother?” And he called them the land of Cabul, even to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Hiram sent to king Solomon one hundred twenty talents of gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>This is the sum of the expenses that king Solomon offered for the building of the house of the Lord, and his own house, and for Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, ascended and seized Gezer, and he burned it with fire.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-394'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And she said to the king: “The word is true, which I have heard in my own land,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then, too, the navy of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought an exceedingly great quantity of thyine wood and precious stones from Ophir.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For Solomon worshipped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom, the idol of the Ammonites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Solomon did what was not pleasing in the sight of the Lord. And he did not continue to follow the Lord, as his father David did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Solomon built a shrine for Chemosh, the idol of Moab, on the mount that is opposite Jerusalem, and for Milcom, the idol of the sons of Ammon.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-429'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, the Lord became angry with Solomon, because his mind had been turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-431'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so, the Lord said to Solomon: “Because you have this with you, and because you have not kept my covenant and my precepts, which I commanded to you, I will tear apart your kingdom, and I will give it to your servant.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-434'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad of Idumea, from an offspring of the king who was in Idumea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-435'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For when David was in Idumea, Joab, the leader of the military, had ascended to bury those who had been killed, and he had killed every male in Idumea.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Hadad fled, he and some men of Idumea from among the servants of his father with him, so that he might enter into Egypt. But Hadad was then a little boy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-438'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when they had risen up from Midian, they went into Paran, and they took with them some men from Paran.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-439'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Hadad found great favor before Pharaoh, so much so that he gave to him as wife, the sister of his own wife, queen Tahpenes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-441'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And when Hadad had heard in Egypt that David had slept with his fathers, and that Joab, the leader of the military, had died, he said to Pharaoh, “Release me, so that I may go to my own land.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-442'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Pharaoh said to him, “But what is lacking to you with me, so that you would seek to go to your own land?” But he responded: “Nothing. Yet I beg you that you may release me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-443'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Also, God raised up against him an adversary, Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadad-Ezer, the king of Zobah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-444'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And he gathered together men against him.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-445'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he was an adversary to Israel during all the days of Solomon. And such is the evil of Hadad and of his hatred against Israel. And he reigned in Syria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-446'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Also, there was Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Zeruah, a widowed woman. He lifted up his hand against the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-447'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And this is the reason for his rebellion against him: that Solomon built up Millo, and that he filled in a deep hole in the city of David, his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-448'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Now Jeroboam was a valiant and powerful man. And perceiving the young man to be ingenious and industrious, Solomon appointed him as first ruler over the tributes of the entire house of Joseph.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-454'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But I will not take the entire kingdom from his hand.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-455'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>But I will take away the kingdom from the hand of his son, and I will give to you ten tribes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-467'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Yet truly, Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, while he was still in Egypt as a fugitive from the face of king Solomon, hearing of his death, returned from Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-468'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And they sent and called him. Therefore, Jeroboam went, with the entire multitude of Israel, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-469'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>“Your father imposed a very harsh yoke upon us. And so, you should now take away a little from the very harsh rule of your father and from his very grievous yoke, which he imposed upon us, and we will serve you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-470'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he said to them, “Go away, until the third day, and then return to me.” And when the people had gone away,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-471'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>king Rehoboam took counsel with the elders who had assisted before his father Solomon while he was still living. And he said, “What counsel do you give to me, so that I may respond to this people?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-472'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They said to him, “If today you will obey and serve this people, and yield to their petition, and if you will speak lenient words to them, they will be your servants for all days.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-473'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But he abandoned the counsel of the old men, which they had given to him. And he consulted the young men who had been raised with him, and who were assisting him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-474'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to them: “What counsel do you give to me, so that I may respond to this people, who have said to me: ‘Make light the yoke that your father imposed on us?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-475'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the young men who had been raised with him, said: “You shall speak in this way to this people, who have spoken to you, saying: ‘Your father weighed down our yoke.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-476'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And now, my father placed a heavy yoke upon you, but I will add more upon your yoke. My father cut you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-477'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, Jeroboam and all the people went to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had spoken, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-478'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the king responded to the people harshly, leaving behind the counsel of the elders that they had given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-479'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: “My father weighed down your yoke, but I will add more to your yoke.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-480'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the king did not acquiesce to the people.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-481'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And so the people, seeing that the king had not been willing to listen to them, responded to him, saying: “What part do we have in David?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-485'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And it happened that, when all of Israel had heard that Jeroboam had returned, gathering an assembly, they sent and called him, and they appointed him as king over all of Israel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-486'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Rehoboam went to Jerusalem, and he gathered together the entire house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand elect men of war, so that they might fight against the house of Israel, and might bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-487'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-490'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then Jeroboam built up Shechem, on mount Ephraim, and he lived there. And departing from there, he built up Penuel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-491'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Jeroboam said in his heart: “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-492'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>if this people ascend to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-493'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And devising a plan, he made two golden calves. And he said to them: “No longer choose to ascend to Jerusalem. Behold, these are your gods, O Israel, who led you away from the land of Egypt!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-494'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And he stationed one in Bethel, and the other in Dan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-495'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And this word became an occasion of sin. For the people went to adore the calf, even to Dan.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-705'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and they cut themselves, in accord with their ritual, with knives and lancets, until they were entirely covered in blood.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And the water was running down around the altar, and the pit of the trench was filled with water.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Ahab reported to Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-728'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And so Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods do these things, and may they add these other things, if by this hour tomorrow I will not have made your life like the life of one of them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-729'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, Elijah was afraid. And rising up, he went away to wherever his will would carry him. And he arrived in Beersheba of Judah. And he dismissed his servant there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-730'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he continued on, into the desert, for one day’s journey.

For I am no better than my fathers.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he stretched himself out, and he slept deeply in the shadow of the juniper tree. And behold, an Angel of the Lord touched him, and said to him, “Rise up and eat.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-732'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He looked, and behold, at his head was bread baked under ashes, and a container of water. Then he ate and drank, and again he slept deeply.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-733'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the Angel of the Lord returned a second time, and touched him, and said to him: “Rise up, eat. For a great journey again stands before you.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when he had arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he responded: “I have been very zealous on behalf of the Lord, the God of hosts.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord passed by.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And after the earthquake, there was a fire. But the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the whisper of a gentle breeze.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when Elijah had heard it, he covered his face with his cloak, and going out, he stood at the entrance of the cave.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>“I have been very zealous on behalf of the Lord, the God of hosts.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-741'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the Lord said to him: “Go, and return on your way, through the desert, to Damascus. And when you have arrived there, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Syria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-745'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Therefore, Elijah, setting out from there, found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, plowing with twelve yoke of oxen.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-746'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And immediately, leaving behind the oxen, he ran after Elijah.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-747'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then, turning back from him, he took a pair of oxen, and he slew them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-756'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and he said: “Let your souls take heed, and see that he commits treachery against us.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-757'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And all those greater by birth, with all the people, said to him, “You should neither listen, nor acquiesce to him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-758'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, he responded to the messengers of Benhadad: “Tell my lord the king: Everything about which you sent to me in the beginning, I your servant will do. But this thing, I am not able to do.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-759'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And returning, the messengers took this to him, and he sent again and said, “May the gods do these things to me, and may they add these other things, if the dust of Samaria is enough to fill the hands of all the people who follow me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-760'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And responding, the king of Israel said, “Tell him that one who is girded should not boast the same as one who is ungirded.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-763'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And behold, one prophet, drawing near to Ahab, the king of Israel, said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Certainly, you have seen this entire exceedingly great multitude?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-764'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said to him: “Thus says the Lord: By the footmen of the leaders of the provinces.” And he said, “Who should begin to do battle?” And he said, “You should.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-765'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, he took a count of the servants of the leaders of the provinces.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-766'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they went out at midday. But Benhadad was drinking; he was inebriated in his pavilion, and the thirty-two kings with him, who had arrived in order to assist him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-767'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the servants of the leaders of the provinces went out to the first place, at the front. And so, Benhadad sent, and they reported to him, saying: “Men have gone out from Samaria.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-768'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he said: “If they have arrived for peace, apprehend them alive; if to do battle, capture them alive.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-769'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Therefore, the servants of the leaders of the provinces went out, and the remainder of the army was following.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-770'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And each one struck down the man who came against him. And the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Also, Benhadad, the king of Syria, fled on a horse, with his horsemen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-771'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But the king of Israel, going out, struck the horses and the chariots, and he struck the Syrians with a great slaughter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-772'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then a prophet, drawing near to the king of Israel, said to him: “Go and be strengthened. And know and see what you are doing. For in the following year, the king of Syria will rise up against you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-773'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then truly, the servants of the king of Syria said to him: “Their gods are the gods of the mountains; because of this, they have overwhelmed us.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-774'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore, you should do this word: Remove each of the kings from your army, and set commanders in their place.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-776'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Therefore, after the passing of the year, Benhadad took a count of the Syrians, and he ascended to Aphek, so that he might fight against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-777'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then the sons of Israel were numbered, and taking provisions, they set out to the opposite side. And they stretched out the camp facing them, like two little flocks of goats. But the Syrians filled the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-778'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And one man of God, drawing near, said to the king of Israel: “Thus says the Lord: Because the Syrians have said, ‘The Lord is the God of the mountains, but he is not the God of the valleys,’ I will deliver this entire great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-779'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And for seven days, both sides arranged each of their battle lines.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-780'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then those who had remained fled to Aphek, into the city.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-781'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And his servants said to him: “Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel show clemency.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-782'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>So they wrapped sackcloth around their waists, and they placed ropes on their heads. And they went to the king of Israel, and they said to him: “Your servant, Benhadad, says: ‘I beg you to let my soul live.’ ” And he replied, “If he is still alive, he is my brother.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-783'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The men accepted this as a good sign. And hastily, they took up the word from his mouth, and they said, “Benhadad is your brother.” And he said to them, “Go, and bring him to me.” Therefore, Benhadad went out to him, and he lifted him onto his chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-784'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And he said to him: “The cities that my father took from your father, I will return. And you may make streets for yourself in Damascus, just as my father made in Samaria. And after we have made a pact, I will withdraw from you.” Therefore, he formed a pact with him, and he released him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-785'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then a certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his associate, by the word of the Lord, “Strike me.” But he was not willing to strike.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-786'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And he said to him: “Because you were not willing to heed the voice of the Lord, behold, you will depart from me, and a lion will slay you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-787'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>But upon finding another man, he said to him, “Strike me.” And he struck him, and wounded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-788'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then the prophet departed. And he met the king along the way, and he changed his appearance by sprinkling dust around his mouth and eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-789'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And when the king had passed by, he cried out to the king, and he said: “Your servant went out to do battle in close quarters. And when one man had fled, a certain person brought him to me, and he said: ‘Guard this man. For if he slips away, your life will take the place of his life, or you will weigh out one talent of silver.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-790'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And while I was distracted, turning one way and another, suddenly, he was not to be seen.” And the king of Israel said to him, “This is your judgment, that which you yourself have decreed.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-791'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then immediately, he wiped away the dust from his face, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-792'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And he said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Because you have released from your hand a man worthy of death, your life will take the place of his life, and your people will take the place of his people.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-793'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And so the king of Israel returned to his house, unwilling to listen, and a fury entered into Samaria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-798'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Naboth responded to him, “May the Lord be gracious to me, lest I give to you the inheritance of my fathers.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-800'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Jezebel, his wife, entered to him, and she said to him: “What is this matter, by which your soul has been saddened? And why do you not eat bread?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-821'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And so, there was no other person similar to Ahab, who was sold so that he did evil in the sight of the Lord. For his wife, Jezebel, urged him on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-822'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And he became abominable, so much so that he followed the idols that the Amorites had made, whom the Lord consumed before the face of the sons of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-823'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then, when Ahab had heard these words, he tore his garments, and he put haircloth on his body, and he fasted, and he slept in sackcloth, and he walked with his head downcast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-824'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And the word of the Lord came to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-825'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>“Have you not seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me?

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-827'>1 Kings 22</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then three years passed without war between Syria and Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-829'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But in the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, descended to the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Are you ignorant that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and that we have neglected to take it from the hand of the king of Syria?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And so he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you come to the battle with me at Ramoth Gilead?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: “As I am, so also are you. My people and your people are one. And my horsemen are your horsemen.” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I beg you to inquire today of the word of the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, the king of Israel gathered together the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them, “Should I go to Ramoth Gilead to make war, or should I be at peace?” They responded, “Ascend, and the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here a particular prophet of the Lord, so that we may inquire by him?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: “One man remains, by whom we may be able to inquire of the Lord: Micaiah, the son of Imlah. But I hate him. For he does not prophecy good to me, but evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “You should not speak in this way, O king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-836'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, the king of Israel called a certain eunuch, and he said to him, “Hurry to bring here Micaiah, the son of Imlah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were each sitting upon his own throne, clothed in the habit of royal vestments, in a courtyard beside the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying in their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Also, Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made for himself horns of iron, and he said, “Thus says the Lord: With these, you shall threaten Syria, until you destroy it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And all the prophets were prophesying similarly, saying: “Ascend to Ramoth Gilead, and go forth to success. For the Lord will deliver it into the hands of the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then truly, the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying: “Behold, the words of the prophets, as if with one mouth, are predicting good to the king. Therefore, let your word be like theirs, and speak what is good.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Micaiah said to him, “As the Lord lives, whatever the Lord will have said to me, this shall I speak.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so he went to the king. And the king said to him, “Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth Gilead to do battle, or should we cease?” And he responded to him, “Ascend, and go forth to success, and the Lord will deliver it into the hands of the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-843'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But the king said to him, “I require you under oath, again and again, that you not say to me anything except what is true, in the name of the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-844'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he said: “I saw all of Israel scattered among the hills, like sheep that have no shepherd. And the Lord said: ‘These have no master. Let each of them return to his own house in peace.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-845'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore, the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: “Did I not tell you that he prophesies nothing good to me, but always evil?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-846'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Yet truly, continuing, he said: “Because of his, listen to the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne. And the entire army of heaven was standing beside him, to the right and to the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-847'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And the Lord said, ‘Who will mislead Ahab, the king of Israel, so that he may ascend and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ And one spoke words in this manner, and another spoke otherwise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But then a spirit went out and stood before the Lord. And he said, ‘I will mislead him.’ And the Lord said to him, ‘By what means?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he said, ‘I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And the Lord said: ‘You will deceive him, and you will prevail. Go forth, and do so.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So now, behold: the Lord has given a lying spirit into the mouth of all your prophets who are here. And the Lord has spoken evil against you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-851'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, drew near and struck Micaiah on the jaw, and he said, “So then, has the Spirit of the Lord left me, and spoken to you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-852'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And Micaiah said, “You shall see in the day when you will enter into a room within a room, so that you may conceal yourself.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the king of Israel said: “Take Micaiah, and let him dwell with Amon, the ruler of the city, and with Joash, the son of Amalech.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And tell them: ‘Thus says the king: Put this man in prison, and sustain him with the bread of affliction, and with the water of distress, until I return in peace.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-855'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And Micaiah said, “If you will have returned in peace, the Lord has not spoken through me.” And he said, “May all the people hear it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-856'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And so, the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, ascended to Ramoth Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-857'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: “Take up your armor, and enter the battle. And be clothed in your own garments.” But the king of Israel changed his clothing, and he entered the war.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-858'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now the king of Syria had instructed the thirty-two commanders of the chariots, saying, “You shall not fight against anyone, small or great, except against the king of Israel alone.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-859'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Therefore, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they suspected that he was the king of Israel. And making a violent assault, they fought against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-860'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And the commanders of the chariots understood that he was not the king of Israel, and so they turned away from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-861'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But a certain man bent his bow, aiming the arrow without certitude, and by chance he struck the king of Israel, between the lungs and the stomach. Then he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me away from the army, for I have been grievously wounded.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-862'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then the battle was undertaken throughout that day. And the king of Israel was standing on his chariot opposite the Syrians, and he died in the evening. For the blood was flowing from the wound into the joints of the chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-863'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And a herald proclaimed throughout the entire army, before the setting of the sun, saying: “Let each one return to his own city, and to his own land.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-864'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Then the king died, and he was carried into Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-865'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And they washed his chariot in the pool of Samaria. And the dogs licked up his blood. And they washed the reins, in accord with the word of the Lord which he had spoken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-866'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But the rest of the words of Ahab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory that he built, and all the cities that he constructed, were these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-867'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And so, Ahab slept with his fathers. And Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-868'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Yet truly, Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa, had begun to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-869'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>He was thirty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-870'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And he walked in the entire way of Asa, his father, and he did not decline from it. And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-871'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Yet truly, he did not take away the high places. For still the people were sacrificing and burning incense in the high places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-872'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat had peace with the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-873'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>But the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, and his works that he did, and the battles, were these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-874'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Then, too, the remnant of the effeminate, who had remained in the days of Asa, his father, he took away from the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-875'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>At that time, there was no king appointed in Idumea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-876'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Yet truly, king Jehoshaphat had made a navy on the sea, which would sail to Ophir for gold. But they were unable to go, because the ships were broken down at Eziongeber.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-877'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants on the ships.” But Jehoshaphat was not willing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-878'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David, his father. And Jehoram, his son, reigned in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-879'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel, in Samaria, in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. And he reigned over Israel for two years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-880'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. And he walked in the way of his father and his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-881'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>Also, he served Baal, and he adored him, and he provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, in accord with all that his father had done.</span></div>
