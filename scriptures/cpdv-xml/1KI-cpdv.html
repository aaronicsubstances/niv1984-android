<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>1 Kings 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now king David had become elderly, and he had many days in his lifetime. And though he was covered with clothes, he was not warmed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, his servants said to him: “Let us seek, for our lord the king, a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and warm him, and sleep in his bosom, and provide warmth for our lord the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And so they sought a beautiful young woman in all the parts of Israel. And they found Abishag, a Shunammite, and they led her to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now the girl was exceedingly beautiful. And she slept with the king, and she ministered to him. Yet truly, the king did not know her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, “I shall reign!” And he appointed for himself chariots and horsemen, with fifty men who would run before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Neither did his father chastise him at any time, saying, “Why have you done this?” Now he, too, was very beautiful, the second in birth, after Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he conferred with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar, the priest, who gave assistance to the side of Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Yet truly, Zadok, the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Shimei and Rei, and the mature men of the army of David were not with Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, having immolated rams and calves and every kind of fat cattle beside the Stone of the Serpent, which was in the vicinity of the fountain Rogel, summoned all his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But he did not summon Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, and all the mature men, and Solomon, his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so Nathan said to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon: “Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has begun to reign, and that our lord David is ignorant of this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now then, come, accept my counsel, and save your life and the life of your son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Go and enter to king David, and say to him: ‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to me, your handmaid, saying: “Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit on my throne?” Then why does Adonijah reign?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And while you are still speaking with the king there, I will enter after you, and I will complete your words.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so Bathsheba entered to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag, the Shunammite, was ministering to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Bathsheba bowed herself, and she reverenced the king. And the king said to her, “What do you wish?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And responding, she said: “My lord, you swore to your handmaid, by the Lord your God: ‘your son Solomon will reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And now behold, Adonijah reigns, while you, my lord the king, are ignorant of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He has slain oxen, and every kind of fattened cattle, and many rams.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Truly now, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel look with favor upon you, that you may indicate to them who ought to sit upon your throne, my lord the king, after you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Otherwise, this will be: when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be as sinners.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, arrived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they announced to the king, saying, “Nathan, the prophet, is here.” And when he had entered in the sight of the king, and he had reverenced prone on the ground,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Nathan said: “My lord the king, did you say, ‘Let Adonijah reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For today, he descended, and he immolated oxen, and fattened cattle, and many rams. And he summoned all the sons of the king, and the leaders of the army, along with Abiathar, the priest. And they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘As king Adonijah lives.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But he did not summon me, your servant, and Zadok, the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon, your lowly servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Could this word have gone out from my lord the king, and could you not have revealed it to me, your servant, as to who would be seated upon the throne of my lord the king after him?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And king David responded, saying, “Summon to me Bathsheba.” And when she had entered before the king, and she had stood before him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>the king swore and said: “As the Lord lives, who has rescued my soul from all distress,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>just as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel, saying: ‘Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne in my place,’ so shall I do this day.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And Bathsheba, having lowered her face to the ground, reverenced the king, saying, “May my lord David live forever.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And king David said, “Summon to me Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada.” And when they had entered before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>he said to them: “Take with you the servants of your lord, and place my son Solomon upon my mule. And lead him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And let Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him in that place as the king over Israel. And you shall sound the trumpet, and you shall say, ‘As king Solomon lives.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And you shall ascend after him, and he shall arrive and shall sit upon my throne. And he himself shall reign in my place. And I will command that he be the ruler over Israel and over Judah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, responded to the king, saying: “Amen. So says the Lord, the God of my lord the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>In the same way that the Lord has been with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon. And may he make his throne more sublime than the throne of my lord, king David.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, descended, with Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites. And they placed Solomon on the mule of king David, and they led him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Zadok, the priest, took the horn of oil from the tabernacle, and he anointed Solomon. And they sounded the trumpet. And all the people said, “As king Solomon lives.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And the entire multitude ascended after him. And the people were playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy. And the earth resounded before the noise of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, and all who had been summoned by him, heard it. And now the feast had ended. Then, too, Joab, hearing the voice of the trumpet, said, “What is the meaning of this clamor from the tumultuous city?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived. And Adonijah said to him, “Enter, for you are a valiant man, and you report good news.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And Jonathan answered Adonijah: “By no means. For our lord king David has appointed Solomon as king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And he has sent with him Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites. And they have placed him on the mule of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, at Gihon. And they are ascending from there, rejoicing, and so the city resounds. This is the noise that you have heard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>But also, Solomon sits upon the throne of the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And the servants of the king, entering, have blessed our lord king David, saying: ‘May God amplify the name of Solomon above your name, and may he magnify his throne above your throne.’ And the king reverenced from his bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And he said: ‘Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who today has bestowed someone to sit upon my throne, while my eyes may see it.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Therefore, all those who had been summoned by Adonijah were terrified. And they all rose up, and each one went his own way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then Adonijah, fearing Solomon, rose up and went away. And he took hold of the horn of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And they reported to Solomon, saying: “Behold, Adonijah, fearing king Solomon, has taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: ‘May king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put to death his servant with the sword.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-1-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And Solomon said: “If he is a good man, not so much as one hair of his head shall fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he shall die.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-1-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Therefore, king Solomon sent and brought him from the altar. And entering, he reverenced king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, “Go to your own house.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘robur’ can mean strong or robust, but it can also mean mature or experienced. So the veterans of the army, who were older and experienced in battle, were faithful to David, despite his decline in his ability to lead, because of old age. But perhaps the newer recruits were impetuous and supported the younger leader, Adonijah.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The people were now swearing their oaths by Solomon, indicating that he is the rightful king, “As king Solomon lives, I shall do this or that.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the days of David had drawn near, so that he would die, and he instructed his son Solomon, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And observe the care of the Lord your God, so that you walk in his ways, so that you care for his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, just as it is written in the law of Moses.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So may the Lord confirm his words, which he has spoken about me, saying: ‘If your sons will guard their ways, and if they will walk before me in truth, with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from you a man on the throne of Israel.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also, you know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, has done to me, what he did to the two leaders of the army of Israel, to Abner, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether. He killed them, and so he shed the blood of war in peace time, and he set the bloodshed of battle on his belt, which was around his waist, and in his shoes, which were on his feet.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Also, you have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, the son of Benjamin, from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went away to the camp.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>yet do not choose to treat him as if he were innocent. Since you are a wise man, you will know what to do with him. And you shall lead away his grey hair to death with blood.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And so, David slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now the days during which David reigned over Israel are forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, thirty-three in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Adonijah, the son of Haggith, entered to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said to him, “Is your entrance peaceful?” He responded, “It is peaceful.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he added, “My word is for you.” She said to him, “Speak.” And he said:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he said: “I beg that you may speak to king Solomon, for he is not able to refuse anything to you, so that he may give Abishag the Shunammite to me as wife.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Bathsheba said: “It is well. I will speak to the king on your behalf.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And she said to him: “I petition one small request from you. May you not confound my face.” And the king said to her: “Ask, my mother. For it is not right that I turn away your face.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah, your brother, as wife.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And king Solomon responded, and he said to his mother: “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Why not request the kingdom for him! For he is my older brother, and he has Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And so king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: “May God do these things to me, and may he add these other things! For Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-84-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who put him to death, and so he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-85-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Also, the king said to Abiathar, the priest: “Go into Anathoth, to your own land, for you are a man worthy of death.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-86-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Therefore, Solomon cast out Abiathar, so that he would not be the priest of the Lord, so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke over the house of Eli at Shiloh.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-88-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And it was reported to king Solomon that Joab had fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and that he was beside the altar.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-89-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the Lord, and he said to him: “The king says this: ‘Come out.’ ” But he said: “I will not come out.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-90-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And the king said to him, “Do just as he has said. And put him to death, and bury him. And so shall you take away the innocent blood, which was shed by Joab, from me and from my father’s house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-91-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And the Lord shall repay his blood upon his own head.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-92-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And their blood shall be turned back upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his offspring forever.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-93-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And so Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and, attacking him, put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the desert.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-796-21-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And after these things, in that time, there was a vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, who was in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab, the king of Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-797-21-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying: “Give your vineyard to me, so that I may make for myself a garden of herbs.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-798-21-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Naboth responded to him, “May the Lord be gracious to me, lest I give to you the inheritance of my fathers.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-799-21-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Ahab went into his house, angry and gnashing his teeth over the word that Naboth, the Jezreelite, had spoken to him, saying, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And casting himself on his bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and he would not eat bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-800-21-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Jezebel, his wife, entered to him, and she said to him: “What is this matter, by which your soul has been saddened? And why do you not eat bread?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-801-21-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he responded to her: “I spoke to Naboth, the Jezreelite, and I said to him: ‘Give your vineyard to me, and accept money.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-815-21-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you discovered me to be your enemy?” And he said: “I have discovered you to have been sold, so that you would do evil in the sight of the Lord:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-834-22-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here a particular prophet of the Lord, so that we may inquire by him?”</span></div>
