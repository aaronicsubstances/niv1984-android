<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you. We give thanks to God always for all of you, keeping the memory of you in our prayers without ceasing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>remembering your work of faith, and hardship, and charity, and enduring hope, in our Lord Jesus Christ, before God our Father.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For our Gospel has not been among you in word alone, but also in virtue, and in the Holy Spirit, and with a great fullness, in the same manner as you know we have acted among you for your sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And so, you became imitators of us and of the Lord, accepting the Word in the midst of great tribulation, but with the joy of the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So have you become a pattern for all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For from you, the Word of the Lord was spread, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith, which is toward God, has advanced so much so that we do not need to speak to you about anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For others are reporting among us of the kind of acceptance we had among you, and how you were converted from idols to God, to the service of the living and true God,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For you yourselves know, brothers, that our acceptance among you was not empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Instead, having previously suffered and been treated shamefully, as you know, at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, so as to speak the Gospel of God to you with much solicitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For our exhortation was not in error, nor from impurity, nor with deception.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But, just as we have been tested by God, so that the Gospel would be entrusted to us, so also did we speak, not so as to please men, but rather to please God, who tests our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And neither did we, at any time, become flattering in speech, as you know, nor did we seek an opportunity for avarice, as God is witness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Nor did we seek the glory of men, neither from you, nor from others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And although we could have been a burden to you, as Apostles of Christ, instead we became like little ones in your midst, like a nurse cherishing her children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So desirous were we for you that we were willing to hand over to you, not only the Gospel of God, but even our own souls. For you have become most beloved to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For you remember, brothers, our hardship and weariness. We preached the Gospel of God among you, working night and day, so that we would not be burdensome to any of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You are witnesses, as is God, of how holy and just and blameless we were with you who have believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And you know the manner, with each one of you, like a father with his sons,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>in which we were pleading with you and consoling you, bearing witness, so that you would walk in a manner worthy of God, who has called you into his kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For this reason also, we give thanks to God without ceasing: because, when you had accepted from us the Word of the hearing of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but (as it truly is) as the Word of God, who is working in you who have believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For you, brothers, have become imitators of the churches of God which are at Judea, in Christ Jesus. For you, too, have suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen as they have suffered from the Jews,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>who also killed both the Lord Jesus, and the Prophets, and who have persecuted us. But they do not please God, and so they are adversaries to all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They prohibit us to speak to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved, and thus do they continually add to their own sins. But the wrath of God will overtake them in the very end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And we, brothers, having been deprived of you for a short time, in sight, but not in heart, have hurried all the more to see your face, with a great desire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For we wanted to come to you, (indeed, I, Paul, attempted to do so once, and then again,) but Satan impeded us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And we sent Timothy, our brother and a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and to exhort you, on behalf of your faith,</span></div>

In other words, when sinful secular society proclaims that they finally have peace and security, because all true religion (which ever accused them of their sins) seems to them to have been defeated, then the sufferings of the second part of the tribulation will overwhelm them. (Something similar, but lesser, happens during the first part of the tribulation (not long from now); when the Warning occurs, many false prophets and foolish persons will claim that the time of peace has begun, but instead the first part of the tribulation will occur.</span></div>
