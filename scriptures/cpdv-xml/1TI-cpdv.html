<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the authority of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>to Timothy, beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now I asked you to remain at Ephesus, while I went into Macedonia, so that you would speak strongly against certain ones who have been teaching a different way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>against those who have been paying attention to fables and endless genealogies. These things present questions as if they were greater than the edification that is of God, which is in faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now the goal of instruction is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Certain persons, wandering away from these things, have been turned aside to empty babbling,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>desiring to be teachers of the law, but understanding neither the things that they themselves are saying, nor what they are affirming about these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But we know that the law is good, if one makes use of it properly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Knowing this, that the law was not set in place for the just, but for the unjust and the insubordinate, for the impious and sinners, for the wicked and the defiled, for those who commit patricide, matricide, or homicide,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>for fornicators, for males who sleep with males, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>which is in accord with the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, the Gospel which has been entrusted to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I give thanks to him who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he has considered me faithful, placing me in the ministry,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>though previously I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contemptuous. But then I obtained the mercy of God. For I had been acting ignorantly, in unbelief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And so the grace of our Lord has abounded greatly, with the faith and love that is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>It is a faithful saying, and worthy of acceptance by everyone, that Christ Jesus came into this world to bring salvation to sinners, among whom I am first.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But it was for this reason that I obtained mercy, so that in me as first, Christ Jesus would display all patience, for the instruction of those who would believe in him unto eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So then, to the King of ages, to the immortal, invisible, solitary God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>This precept I commend to you, my son Timothy, in accord with the prophets who preceded you: that you serve among them like a soldier in a good war,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>holding to faith and good conscience, against those who, by rejecting these things, have made a shipwreck of the faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-24'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The phrase ‘masculorum concubitoribus’ refers to homosexuality; the word ‘concubitoribus’ is masculine plural, and the word ‘masculorum’ refers to males generally. Since Paul adds ‘whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine’ female homosexuality is also condemned.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Paul is not saying that he is literally the worst sinner of all, but merely that he was among the worst sinners; ‘first’ is used as a superlative in the general sense of ‘very much so,’ and not in the absolute sense of ‘more so than any other.’</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-25'>1 Timothy 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so I beg you, first of all, to make supplications, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings for all men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>for kings, and for all who are in high places, so that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and chastity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For there is one God, and one mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>who gave himself as a redemption for all, as a testimony in its proper time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Of this testimony, I have been appointed a preacher and an Apostle, (I speak the truth, I do not lie) as a teacher of the Gentiles, in faith and in truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, I want men to pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger or dissension.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Similarly also, women should be dressed fittingly, adorning themselves with compunction and restraint, and not with plaited hair, nor gold, nor pearls, nor costly attire,</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to be in authority over a man, but to be in silence.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Adam was not seduced, but the woman, having been seduced, was in transgression.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Yet she will be saved by bearing children, if she has continued in faith and love, and in sanctification accompanied by self-restraint.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘verecundia’ does not simply mean ‘modesty.’ It often means shame, but in this context, it is more of the meaning of recoiling from anything that would be shameful. Compunction expresses this meaning in English fairly well, referring to an exercise of conscience occasioned by the prospect of wrongdoing. The word ‘sobrietate’ in this context does not refer to restraint in drinking, nor in thinking, but to restraint in the manner of dressing and grooming.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-43'>1 Timothy 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>It is a faithful saying: if a man desires the episcopate, he desires a good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, it is necessary for a bishop to be beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, gracious, chaste, hospitable, a teacher,</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-3-1" id="cpdv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>not a drunkard, not combative but restrained, not quarrelsome, not covetous;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>but a man who leads his own house well, having children who are subordinate with all chastity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For if a man does not know how to lead his own house, how will he take care of the Church of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He must not be a new convert, lest, being elated by pride, he may fall under the sentence of the devil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And it is necessary for him also to have good testimony from those who are outside, so that he may not fall into disrepute and the snare of the devil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Similarly, deacons must be chaste, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not pursuing tainted profit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>holding to the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And these things should be proven first, and then they may minister, being without offense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Similarly, the women must be chaste, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Deacons should be the husband of one wife, men who lead their own children and their own houses well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For those who have ministered well will acquire for themselves a good position, and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I am writing these things to you, with the hope that I will come to you soon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But, if I am delayed, you should know the manner in which it is necessary to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and the foundation of truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And it is clearly great, this mystery of piety, which was manifested in the flesh, which was justified in the Spirit, which has appeared to Angels, which has been preached to the Gentiles, which is believed in the world, which has been taken up in glory.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-62'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> The expression ‘husband of one wife’ has an idiomatic meaning, that he be a devoted husband; the literal meaning also applies, he should not be a man who has married more than once. In the early Church, many Church leaders had converted during their adult life, so many were already married; thus, it was necessary to permit a married man to be a Bishop. Very soon in the history of the Church, the Holy Spirit wisely guided the faithful to prefer celibate men for the Episcopate.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘modestum’ in Latin has a broader range of meaning than the word ‘modesty’ in English. Often, the word ‘modestum’ does mean modesty, but in the context of this phrase (‘non percussorem, sed modestum’), it has the broader meaning of self-restraint in general.</span></div>
