      <content> Note about the numbering of the Psalms: The numbering of the Psalms used in the CPDV is the same as the numbering in the Sixtus V and Clement VIII Latin Vulgate, with a few minor changes. The more typical numbering seen in many other versions of the Bible in English is according to the Hebrew text.</content>

      <content> Or, more loosely translated: &#8220;Blessed is the man who has not followed the advice of the impious, and has not stood in the street among sinners, and has not sat in the company of complainers.&#8221;</content>

    <note num="3">
      <content> The Douay-Rheims notes are particularly insightful on this verse: &#8220;Blessed [Note: [a] He is in the right way to eternal happiness. ] is the man, that hath [Note: [b] not consented to evil suggestions. ] not gone in the counsel of the impious, &amp; hath [Note: [c] not continued in sin. ] not stood in the way of sinners, and hath [Note: [d] not finally persisted in wicked life. ] not sit in the chair of pestilence:&#8221;</content>
    </note>
    <note num="4">
      <content> Note that, in translating the Psalms, I have decided to choose accuracy and a more literal rendering, over a looser and more poetic phrasing of the text. The reason is that a looser translation, obscures some of the meaning.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="5">
      <content> The verb &#8216;resurgent&#8217; could be translated as &#8216;prevail again&#8217; or as &#8216;rise up again.&#8217; The translation &#8216;the impious will not rise up again in the judgment&#8217; is avoided because both the just and the unjust will rise again at the general resurrection on the day of judgment.</content>

      <content> The phrase &#8216;Filius meus es tu&#8217; is a good example of how word order in Latin differs from word order in English.

      <content> Usually, &#8216;finem&#8217; refers to the end or limit of something, but the root of the word is related to &#8216;findo,&#8217; which means to divide into parts. Thus the word &#8216;finem&#8217; typically means &#8216;the last part.&#8217; But, in the context of the Psalms, which were in ancient times, as they are still today, sung or chanted, the phrase &#8216;in finem&#8217; can mean &#8216;in parts.&#8217; This expression refers to a song that is divided into different singing parts (e.g. a duet, or a song with parts for a chorus and parts for individuals), or to a poem that is divided into different speaking parts.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content> However, there is a more meaningful translation of &#8216;in finem.&#8217; The notes of the Douay-Rheims version interpret &#8216;in finem&#8217; (&#8216;unto the end&#8217;) to refer to the New Testament: &#8216;pertaining unto the new Testament.&#8217; And the Wycliffe version translates &#8216;in finem&#8217; as &#8216;for victories,&#8217; i.e. pertaining to a successful end. Thus, &#8216;in finem&#8217; in this translation is usually rendered as &#8216;unto the end,&#8217; since this translation makes the most fulfilling meanings most accessible.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;carminibus&#8217; refers to a card for working with wool or flax. It is a card with many divisions or parts. In this context, &#8216;carminibus&#8217; refers to the division of the psalm into verses. In ancient times, the Bible was not divided into verses. Perhaps the first application of this concept to the Bible was in the psalms, which had to be divided into verses, because it is poetry and because it is sung.</content>

The context is that of being vindicated and liberated from great harm, and of confessing to God among the nations of the world. Therefore, the phrase does not mean to merely recite a psalm, but to compose a psalm. (Composition in ancient times was probably most often done in spoken words, since most persons were illiterate and those who were literate did much less reading and writing than the average person today.)</content>

      <content> This psalm is about the time of early morning, metaphorically referring to the end of a dark time, and to the beginning of a time of light, when God saves at the end of suffering. It is also a fitting psalm for the start of the day.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;unicornium&#8217; does not refer to the mythical horse with a single horn. It refers literally to some type of wild animal with one horn in ancient times. This animal is most likely some species that has since gone extinct. Some have speculated that it could refer to the rhinoceros of India (Rhinoceros unicornis), which has one horn, unlike its African cousin, which has two horns. It also has a figurative meaning. Notice that the first part of the verse refers to being saved by lions. It is not the case that the Israelites were largely afraid of being eaten by lions; rather, the lion is figurative for a king or for governmental authority. Save me from governmental authority gone astray. Likewise, save my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast. This beast could represent law enforcement and military bodies gone astray. Guns and tanks can be figuratively said to have a single horn, yet they shoot many horns (bullets, etc.) from their single horn. May I be humble in the face of law enforcement and military authorities gone astray.</content>

      <content> The single-horned beast can also be said to be a figure of the Antichrist&#8217;s kingdom. The figure of a horn is often used in the Old Testament to signify a leader of a kingdom. The Antichrist&#8217;s kingdom has a single horn, in the sense that he is one leader who will have dominion over nearly the whole world. And it has many horns, in that there are many other leaders who exercise authority under the Antichrist.</content>

      <content> The phrase &#8216;commorantium in circuitu&#8217; refers to people who are not living in the general area, but who have come to the area and are lingering there. The phrase &#8216;in eo&#8217; refers to the phrase &#8216;in circuitu,&#8217; i.e. it refers to a place, so it is translated loosely as &#8216;there,&#8217; rather than as &#8216;in it.&#8217;</content>

      <content> Or, &#8220;The understanding of David to himself.&#8221; Or, &#8220;David&#8217;s own understanding.&#8221; This phrase has been often misunderstood. The word &#8216;intellectus&#8217; is nominative, so it is the subject. The name David, and other non-Latin names written in Latin, often do not change their ending, despite being in various cases in various sentences. The word &#8216;David&#8217; in this sentence is genitive (the understanding of David, or, David&#8217;s understanding). The word &#8216;ipsi&#8217; is dative (to himself), but in English we would express this idea not by saying &#8216;The understanding of David to himself,&#8217; but by saying, &#8216;The understanding of David himself.&#8217; In other words, this psalm is about David&#8217;s own understanding. It is a psalm that describes things from David&#8217;s point of view.</content>

      <content> Notice that the word &#8216;pes&#8217; is singular, but the translation makes it plural. The reason is that English uses this same type of expression (referring to feet figuratively), but with the plural, not the singular.</content>

      <content> The phrase &#8216;offspring of,&#8217; or &#8216;sons of,&#8217; is a figure of speech often used in the Old Testament. It does not literally mean that a child will perish if his parents sin. It means that if you sin continually, you are acting as if you were the offspring of sin. Thus, &#8216;semen impiorum peribit&#8217; could be translated as &#8216;the offspring of impiety will perish.&#8217; In another example, the &#8216;sons of adultery&#8217; are not the biological sons of adulterers, but they are those who act as if they had adultery itself as a parent. This figure of speech is predicated on the idea that children learn most from their parents. If you commit adultery, it is as if your parents were adulterers, or as if your parent was adultery itself.</content>

      <content> The words &#8216;fiat, fiat&#8217; call to mind the words of the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke: &#8220;Ecce ancilla Domini, fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum.&#8221; The Latin &#8216;fiat&#8217; in this Psalm is a translation of the Hebrew &#8216;Amen&#8217; (which is also used in Aramaic). Fiat can be translated as &#8216;let it be&#8217; or as &#8216;so be it.&#8217; Amen can be translated in the same way, and also as &#8216;truly.&#8217;</content>

However, &#8216;divites&#8217; is clearly masculine plural: &#8216;all the rich men of the people.&#8217; Ordinarily, a translator ought to prefer to translate one noun with one noun, but English does not allow one to indicate gender, even with many words that refer to people, such as &#8216;the rich&#8217; or &#8216;the wealthy.&#8217; Since the first part of the verse is clearly referring to the women of wealthy Tyre, the last part is also specifically meant to indicate the successful wealthy men among the people (not merely any or all of the people. Keeping the gender references intact in this verse is essential to understanding its meaning.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;pusillanimitate&#8217; is actually two Latin words put together. The first refers to a very young animal, but is used to express the idea of weakness. The second word refers to the mind, or soul, or spirit. The effect of putting the two words together results in an expression of the idea of a weak soul or a weak mind. Thus, &#8216;pusillanimitate spiritus&#8217; refers to a weak-minded soul. The last word, &#8216;tempestate,&#8217; in this context, refers not to a literal wind-storm, but to a tempest of the mind and soul, i.e. to inner turmoil. It can also be taken to refer to a storm of words or of various kinds of opposition to truth and justice.</content>

      <content> Again, &#8216;psalmum dicam&#8217; could be translated as &#8216;recite a psalm.&#8217; But, after all the great and merciful things that this and other psalms say that God has done, is the response of the Psalmist merely to recite a psalm. Is not the one who wrote this psalm a composer of psalms? So then, his response would not be merely to recite a memorized psalm, but to compose one. Psalms were composed in ancient times, not so much by sitting down and writing, but by speaking the psalm first, and writing it later.</content>

      <content> There are two possible meanings here (at least). One meaning is that God is angry despite (over and above) the prayer of His servant. The other meaning is that He is angry at the inappropriate or sinful prayer of someone who is otherwise a servant of God. Some make the mistake of the Pharisee, praying with some degree of selfishness or self-exaltation. Prayer is not necessarily pleasing to God.</content>

      <content> The text literally means &#8216;in them,&#8217; but &#8216;them&#8217; refers to &#8216;the heavens.&#8217; The translation of &#8216;there&#8217; makes this reference clearer, since English does not generally refer to Heaven as &#8216;them.&#8217;</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;consilio&#8217; in Latin can refer to either a deliberative group (council) or to a process of deliberating and giving advice (counsel). But in translating the Latin into English, one must choose within that broad range of meaning. The Latin word has a broader range of meaning than English words that could be used to translate. In this case, the translation is &#8216;counsel&#8217; because God is more glorified in the deliberations, decisions, and advice of those who are holy than he is glorified by meetings of councils.</content>

      <content> This last part of the verse refers to the trans-substantiation, that is, to the consecration of bread and wine to become the body and blood of Christ. The word &#8216;commutation&#8217; refers to changing one thing into another. The commutation that gives us Christ in the Eucharist is called trans-substantiation. The doctrine of trans-substantiation is true doctrine, but the terminology itself is superfluous. Another term could be used to describe the same truth.</content>

      <content> The first two words are usually translated as &#8216;to this David,&#8217; or &#8216;to the same David.&#8217; The word &#8216;huic&#8217; is dative, indicating an indirect object, which is often translated using the English &#8216;to&#8217; or &#8216;for.&#8217; Essentially, the first word, &#8216;huic&#8217; translates as &#8216;for this,&#8217; or &#8216;to this.&#8217; The word &#8216;David&#8217; (as with many non-Latin names) is not usually altered in its ending to indicate case. The translation could be &#8216;To this David,&#8217; but then the word &#8216;this&#8217; would not be of much use, except to indicate the case of the word &#8216;David,&#8217; i.e. &#8216;To David,&#8217; rather than &#8216;To this David.&#8217; Another possible translation (a somewhat loose translation), would be to view &#8216;David&#8217; as the subject: &#8216;David is for this,&#8217; which can be rephrased in English as &#8216;This is for David.&#8217;</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content> So the translation should be either: &#8216;To David,&#8217; or, &#8216;This is for David.&#8217; Both of which have approximately the same meaning.</content>

      <content> The phrase &#8216;ante luciferum&#8217; has a level of meaning whereby it refers to Lucifer, the devil. The meaning here is that God&#8217;s only Son was begotten in eternity, before the Angels were created, before the Angels fell from grace, before Lucifer (the light-bearer) became Satan (the adversary). The phrase &#8216;ex utero&#8217; does not mean &#8216;from the womb,&#8217; but has more of the meaning of &#8216;from conception.&#8217; The word &#8216;utero&#8217; is often used in Latin to refer to the generative capability (the ability to bring about conception) of men and women. In this case, it refers to the generative capability of the Father to give rise to the Son by procession.</content>

This passage also indicates that when Christ returns, Mary will return with him; then, at the Second Ascension, Christ will ascend to Heaven and Mary will again be assumed into Heaven, rising up with him to the place of eternal rest.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;confessio&#8217; can refer to confessing or admitting something (e.g. that God is Lord of heaven and earth). It can also refer to an acknowledgment or understanding about something (e.g. having a belief in God). Such an admission or acknowledgment often has a pervasive element of praise and thanksgiving to God. However, the translation of &#8216;confessio&#8217; as if it meant merely &#8216;to give praise&#8217; is not accurate.</content>
