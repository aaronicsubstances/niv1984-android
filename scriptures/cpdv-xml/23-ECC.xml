      <content> This book is attributed to king Solomon, being based on his words of wisdom from God. Solomon is called Ecclesiastes because he calls the people to an assembly (ecclesia), so as to teach them wisdom.</content>

      <content> The meridian is midday (i.e. the highest point that the sun reaches in the sky) or more generally the middle of the sky (i.e. neither horizon). The term meridian may also be translated as &#8216;south,&#8217; referring to the fact that the sun is more to the south when viewed from locations in the northern hemisphere, such as Jerusalem. The sun then arcs more toward the north (but not actually north of due west); this is particularly evident in winter and at higher latitudes, where the sun is fairly low in the southern sky about midday, and then arcs more toward the north as it sets.</content>

      <content>And all that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them. Neither did I prohibit my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and from amusing itself in the things that I had prepared. And I regarded this as my share, as if I were making use of my own labors.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But when I turned myself toward all the works that my hands had made, and to the labors in which I had perspired to no purpose, I saw emptiness and affliction of the soul in all things, and that nothing is permanent under the sun.</content>

      <content>All his days have been filled with sorrows and hardships; neither does he rest his mind, even in the night. And is this not emptiness?</content>

    <verse num="26">
      <content>God has given, to the man who is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and rejoicing. But to the sinner, he has given affliction and needless worrying, so as to add, and to gather, and to deliver, to him who has pleased God. But this, too, is emptiness and a hollow worrying of the mind.</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The lack of remembrance of the wise pertains to the world, not to heaven and the kingdom of God. Those immersed in the world choose to forget the past and its lessons, lest they be corrected and have to give up the sins that they love. This verse is also prophetic; in the last days, the world will forget, or cover over, or teach falsehoods about various events in the past which would have corrected their errors. They will cover past truths with the oblivion of their sinfulness.</content>
