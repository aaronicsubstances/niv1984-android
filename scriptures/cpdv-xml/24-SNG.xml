      <content>Labels of &#8216;Bride,&#8217; &#8216;Groom,&#8217; and &#8216;Chorus&#8217; are not in the source text, and are added to clarify the meaning of the text. However, some labels might not apply to some levels of meaning of some verses.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content>The first, fifth, and seventh chapters have been re-numbered so that each verse contains only the words of one particular speaker: Groom, Bride, or Chorus.
&lt;br&gt;
+There is a spiritual level of meaning to the text in which the Groom is Christ, the Bride is the Church, and the Chorus is those who are not yet mature in the Faith.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content>The bride is speaking about her desire for the groom. The pronoun &#8216;sui&#8217; is singular masculine; it cannot be singular feminine; therefore, this is the bride speaking about the groom.
&lt;br&gt;
+The bride is the Church, who constantly seeks the love of the Christ and hopes for His blessings.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="4">
      <content>Now the groom is speaking about his bride&#8217;s breasts and perfume, which symbolize her feminine beauty, both outer and inner. Therefore, this must be the groom speaking about the bride. Although &#8216;unguentis&#8217; is usually translated as &#8216;ointments,&#8217; in this context it clearly refers to perfumes. In ancient times, oils and resins were used for their fragrant smell.
&lt;br&gt;
+Jesus Christ admires His Church, which is so much more than the Sacraments and Blessings which He gives to Her. The fragrances are the prayers and sacrifices of the faithful. Her breasts nourish those who are infants in the faith with teachings of Truth. She raises holy children for God.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="5">
      <content>The Bride is speaking about her groom, saying that the maidens (or adolescent girls) are attracted to him, (they wish that they were marrying the groom, instead of the bride). She asks him to draw her to him.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ draws the Church to Him and to the Father. The Church asks to be drawn by Christ. Many who are not mature in the Faith (the maidens, who are not yet ready to be brides), and some who might not even be Christians at all, are drawn to Christ out of love for him.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="6">
      <content> This cannot be the bride speaking, because the speaker is plural. Also, the person they are running after is perfumed, so they must be running after the bride. Therefore, this is the chorus of maidens speaking. The Chorus is those adolescent girls mentioned in the verse above, who are attracted to the groom. They admire the bride; they wish that they were getting married in her place. As the bride is drawn to the groom, they are drawn by admiration of her to follow after her.
&lt;br&gt;
+The adolescent girl chorus represents those who are not mature in the Faith, but who are attracted to Christ and His Church. As Christ draws the Church forward, they run after the Church, attracted by the Church&#8217;s perfumes (prayers, sacrifices, holiness, etc.).</content>
    </note>
    <note num="7">
      <content>The chorus says that they will follow the bride, and the bride replies by saying where she is being led, i.e. where they will also go if they follow her: into the storerooms (including those of wine, as we find out later in the book). The groom, on the historical or literal level of meaning, is king Solomon.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church replies to those who listen to Her and who admire Her, that the king (God the Father) is leading Her into his storerooms, which represent the resources of the Faith, including the Sacraments and the Teachings that have been preserved through the ages. Since they expressed a desire to run after the Church, the Church then informs them of where the Father (King) is leading them.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="8">
      <content>The &#8216;we&#8217; is the chorus speaking about the bride. They tell her that her breasts, symbolic of her inner feminine beauty, are better than the wine of the king&#8217;s storerooms.
&lt;br&gt;
+After the Church tells its admirers that it is being led into the storerooms of the king, the chorus of admirers replies that they exult and rejoice in the Church and its teachings, even above the gifts of the Sacraments. For those who receive the Sacraments, without believing and following the teachings of the Church, will not be saved.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="9">
      <content>Now it is the groom&#8217;s turn to speak. The word &#8216;recti&#8217; is nominative plural; so this is not the chorus saying &#8216;we&#8217; love you, but the groom saying to the bride why they, the chorus, love her. This is not the bride speaking to the groom, because it follows after the chorus&#8217; expression of admiration and love for the bride. Therefore, it is an explanation as to why the chorus of girls finds the bride so admirable: it is because they are maturing in righteousness and are therefore attracted to a woman who is more righteous than they are. The Bride&#8217;s feminine beauty, symbolized by her breasts, is the inner beauty of righteousness.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ tells the Church that those who are righteous, who love truth and justice and mercy, will also love the Church. This explains why even those outside the Church find the Church attractive.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="10">
      <content>In the historical level of meaning, the bride is dark-skinned and from Africa (a Sulamite, as we later learn). The Latin word &#8216;pelles&#8217; is here used to refer to tents, or hangings in tents, made from animal skins. The tents of Kedar were literally black, made from black animal hair. This must be the bride speaking because the feminine form of the words &#8216;nigra&#8217; and &#8216;formosa&#8217; are used (both words have a masculine form which could have been used if this was the groom speaking).
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church says to those who are immature in the Faith (some are members of the Church, others are formally outside the Church, but are attracted to Her teachings and holiness) that the Church is attractive, but dark. The darkness of the Church is found in the mysteries of the Church which can never be fully understood by the human mind, and also in the darkness (lack of understanding) that the world has toward the Church, so that the Church seems dark to the world. The tents symbolize the Church as a shelter, a home, a place of worship, and a place of wisdom (the tents of Solomon, a wise king).</content>
    </note>
    <note num="11">
      <content> The bride is speaking about herself, because the word 'fusca' in Latin is in the feminine, yet there is a masculine version of that same word which could have been used if the speaker were male. She says that the sun has changed her skin color, perhaps meaning, not that she herself used to have a light-colored skin, but that her ancestors developed dark skin from living in a hot and sunny climate (Africa).
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church is asking those in the world, who are attracted by her holiness, not to be dissuaded from approaching Her due to her darkness (her mysteries that cannot be fully understood, and her rejection by the world), for the Son of God has made her dark.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="12">
      <content> The bride is speaking about herself, because the word &#8216;meae&#8217; in Latin is in the feminine, yet there is a masculine version of that same word which could have been used if the speaker were male. So this is still the bride speaking; she tells how she was mistreated by the sons of her mother. In that culture and time period, a man might have more than one wife, so that the sons of her mother are children of the same father and mother as she has. They are her closest relatives, after her father and mother; yet they mistreated her.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church is speaking about the sons of the mother of the Church, that is, about priests, who are in truth ordained as sons of the Virgin Mary. Yet, at various times in the history and future of the pilgrim Church on earth, some of these sons have fought against the example of Mary and the teaching of the Church. They have tried to make the Church the keeper of their vineyards, of their mistaken idea of what the Church should be, rather than assisting the Church in keeping to its own teachings. Since the speaker is a woman, also implied is the error of those misguided priests who give inappropriate roles to women, even roles only fitting for the ordained (keeping vineyards that should be kept by priests), and thereby prevent those women from keeping to their own proper tasks (their own vineyard).</content>
    </note>
    <note num="13">
      <content>The bride speaks about her groom and his companions. The words for &#8216;your companions&#8217; (sodalium tuorum) are masculine; therefore, she is speaking about him and his friends. Also, &#8216;quem&#8217; is singular masculine, again indicating that she is speaking about him.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church and the faithful ask the Christ to know more about Him. Similarly, in John 1:38, two disciples ask Jesus where he lives. Also, we are warned about the danger of following someone other than Christ, even those who seem to be His companions.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="14">
      <content>Now the groom speaks about his bride, who is most beautiful among women, asking her to seek to know him better by doing, not merely by words.
&lt;br&gt;
+ Even though the Church is very beautiful, partly due to her knowledge of the Truth, She does not know every truth and must continually seek further knowledge of God. The Christ tells the Church to learn more about him by pasturing the flocks of young goats (those immature in the Faith, the newest members, and those moving toward the Church but not yet members) beside the tabernacles of the shepherds.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="15">
      <content>The groom is still speaking, because &#8216;my love&#8217; is feminine, so he is speaking about her. Also, he has of a company of soldiers with horses, so he must be male. The bride did not have a company of horsemen, for she was mistreated by her brothers and made to tend a vineyard. The company of horsemen the groom commands are not part of the chariots of Pharaoh, rather they are compared versus the chariots of Pharaoh, against whom they fight successfully. The groom is Solomon; these horsemen are his best.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ speaks to the Church, comparing the Church to the one elect group of soldiers among many other soldiers, just as the Church is the elect one drawn out of the many pagan nations by God. Therefore, this is the Groom speaking about the Bride. The Church successfully fights against secular society.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="16">
      <content>The groom continues speaking; the comparison of cheeks to those of a dove must refer to a woman. The word &#8216;monilia&#8217; has the sense of jewelry, but also of a collar worn as adornment.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ admires His Church and her spiritual beauty: her face has the peacefulness of a dove, her neck needs no expensive jewelry, for it is, in and of itself, an adornment. The neck is that which supports the head and the neck of the Church are those who support its ordained leaders with prayer, sacrifice, and works of mercy. The priests of the Church wear a collar, which is like a spiritual bejeweled necklace.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="17">
      <content>The chorus is indicated by the word &#8216;we;&#8217; these adolescent girls would be close to marring age and would have already been taught various skills, such as weaving or making jewelry. Silver ore is a reddish color (rust/gray), often called &#8216;red silver ore.&#8217; The term &#8216;vermiculatas argento&#8217; refers to silver which has a reddish color, perhaps deliberately reddened with an alloy, to accent the gold. The use of the word &#8216;accented&#8217; in the translation is based on the context and on the &#8216;at&#8217; in &#8216;vermiculatas&#8217; which has the sense of &#8216;provided with&#8217; or &#8216;having.&#8217; The word &#8216;vermiculum&#8217; is found in the Latin text of the book of Exodus, referring to a reddish color used in making the tabernacle of the testimony.
&lt;br&gt;
+Those who are immature in the Faith, and those who are not yet members or full members of the Church, will so admire the Church that they will give gold and silver for its adornment. The red in the silver represents the blood of martyrs; those who formerly persecuted the Church will eventually become her admirers and will give her gifts of silver and gold.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="18">
      <content>The word &#8216;nardus&#8217; refers to a particular plant from whose roots is derived an aromatic oil used for perfume as well as medicine.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church has the balms needed to heal all those who suffer in body or in soul. This ability to heal, especially to heal the soul, is like an aromatic ointment attracting those who need healing.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="19">
      <content>Myrrh is associated with death, as well as with healing; it was used in incense and perfumes and ointments.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church has Christ himself for its healing (through the Sacraments, esp. the Eucharist); the Church is healed by graces from the death of Christ. Those graces enliven our prayers, which are like incense rising as a sweet smell before the throne of God.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="20">
      <content>The bride is speaking; she refers to the groom as &#8216;my beloved&#8217; which is masculine in Latin (dilectus meus). &#8216;Botrus Cypri&#8217; refers to a cluster of grapes from Cyprus. The word &#8216;Cypri&#8217; means Cyprus. The island of Cyprus has an ancient tradition of wine-making going back over four thousand years; their grapes and wine were renown, even in ancient times. The word Cypri does not refer to the cypress tree, except that the island was perhaps named after that tree. Botrus means &#8216;cluster of grapes,&#8217; and this is also clear from the subsequent reference to a vineyard. Engaddi was a type of oasis, a town located where a warm spring was in ancient times, near the Dead Sea.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ is the source of the consecrated wine of the Church, just as grapes are the source of ordinary wine. The grapes and wines of Cyprus were renown, just as the Sacraments of Christ are and shall be renown.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="21">
      <content>The groom speaks about his bride, using the feminine Latin words &#8216;mea amica.&#8217;
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ admires the beauty of the Church, particularly its eyes, which symbolize the ability of the Church to see and recognize the truth.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="22">
      <content>She is speaking about him, using the masculine &#8216;dilecte mi&#8217; and &#8216;decorus.&#8217; Now, for the first time, she uses &#8216;our&#8217; (a plural pronoun) to refer to herself and the groom united in love.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church admires the Christ, who is love and the source of grace for the Church. The marriage bed flourishing symbolizes the mystical union of Christ and His Church, which is an abundant source of blessings for the world.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="23">
      <content>Now it is his turn to speak; he speaks about how the house was built. Notice that the use of the word &#8216;cypressina&#8217; to mean &#8216;of cypress&#8217; differs substantially from the previous verse using &#8216;cypri&#8217; to mean &#8216;of Cyprus&#8217;.
&lt;br&gt;
+Here Christ the Groom for the first time uses &#8216;our&#8217; to refer to the union of the Groom and His Bride the Church. He waits until she says it first, because that union of Christ and His Church depends upon her &#8216;yes,&#8217; her &#8216;fiat.&#8217;</content>

      <content>She describes herself as a flower, so this cannot be him speaking. The word &#8216;campi&#8217; is not synonymous with &#8216;field&#8217;; it tends more toward the meaning of a wide open space. The prefix &#8216;con&#8217; intensifies the meaning of the world, so that the valley is not just any valley, but a steep (inaccessible) one.
&lt;br&gt;
+The bride is the Church. A flower of the open field is accessible, but a lily in a steep valley is difficult to reach. Similarly, the Faith of the Church is accessible, yet contains mysteries difficult to reach and impossible to fully attain. The bride is also a type of the Virgin Mary; she is accessible by our prayers, yet she is ineffable.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> He uses the feminine form &#8216;amica&#8217; to speak about her, so this is the groom speaking.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church is a flower among the thorns of secular institutions and secular society. The sinless Virgin Mary is like a flower among the thorns of sin in this world.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content>She refers to him by the masculine word &#8216;dilectus&#8217; and says that he is better than his male peers, &#8216;filios&#8217;. She also uses the masculine: &#8220;illius quem.&#8221; He is figuratively the tree, so she is the one sitting under it.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ is like an apple tree, providing good food, versus the other trees of the forest (secular society) which do not provide food. The desired one is the Christ; those who rest in His shadow find true rest in His teachings and true food in the Eucharist.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="4">
      <content>This verse is her speaking, continuing the previous idea in chapter 1 of king Solomon (i.e. the groom) bringing her into his storeroom of wine.
&lt;br&gt;
+The previous verse taught of Christ providing true food in the Eucharist; this next verse again mentions the Eucharist (and the other Sacraments), under the figure of a storeroom of wine, and then tells us that the Eucharist sets charity, that is, true spiritual love, in order within us.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="5">
      <content>Still the bride is speaking; this is the language of a woman, talking about being propped up with flowers and languishing due to love. Her language is figurative, not literal.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church languishes out of love for God, which can never be completely fulfilled in this life, but only in the next life, in Eternity with God. She asks the maidens (the virgins and the chaste) to support the Church with their prayers and obedience.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="6">
      <content>She continues, speaking about his embrace. Again, it pertains to a woman to be embraced, and to a man to do the embracing. Also, if it were her right hand embracing, she would not be asleep, but we learn that she is asleep in the next verse, so he is the one embracing her.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ supports the head of the Church, who is the Pope, with his brother Bishops; but Christ also embraces the whole Church and all of its members.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="7">
      <content>He now speaks to her peers, the other daughters of Jerusalem, asking them not to wake his beloved (&#8216;dilectam&#8217; is the feminine form of the word), until she (ipsa, feminine) wills.
&lt;br&gt;
+The daughters of Jerusalem, in this context, are those who are immature in the Faith (the adolescent girls, who admire the Bride but are not yet ready themselves to be married). Christ asks them not to disturb the Church, but to be attentive to its will. The Church takes its rest in Christ.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="8">
      <content>The word &#8216;dilectus&#8217; (beloved) is masculine, so she is speaking about him.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Return of Christ is referred to in this passage. First, the voice of Christ will be heard; then, the image of Christ will be seen; Christ will return from Heaven, descending from the clouds. The verse Nahum 1:15 also refers to Christ and Mary returning along the mountain tops: &#8220;Behold, over the mountains, the feet of the evangelizer and the announcer of peace.&#8221;</content>

      <content>She speaks about him using the masculine &#8216;dilectus.&#8217;

    </note>
    <note num="11">
      <content>She speaks about him using the masculine &#8216;dilectus.&#8217; She is attentive to his words.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church is attentive to the words of Christ.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="12">
      <content>He calls her by several feminine terms: &#8216;amica&#8217; (love or loved one), &#8216;columba&#8217; (dove), &#8216;formosa&#8217; (shapely one) and he calls her to come forward.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ exhorts the Church to rise up in prayer, and to quickly advance along the path of holiness. Christ admires the beauty of the Church.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="13">
      <content>He explains why she should rise up and advance, continuing from the previous sentence. It is now springtime, a good time for traveling, or for growth. Winter is the rainy season in the Holy Land.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ exhorts the Church to continual renewal, but also to quickly advance in holiness during times when opportunity is more favorable, as when a time of sinfulness is past, or when a time of persecution is completed. After the Three Days of Darkness, there will be a springtime (literal and figurative), during which the Church will rapidly advance in holiness.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="14">
      <content>He continues the previous description, about the arrival of spring, which is a figure of blossoming love.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ knows every flower of faith and holiness which blooms in the Church, however small it may be. He prunes those who advance in holiness to make them even holier. The dove represents peace after a time of sinfulness and persecution.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="15">
      <content>He continues the previous description and he then refers to her by the feminine &#8216;amica&#8217; and &#8216;speciosa.&#8217; Again, spring is referred to as a time of opportunity.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ calls His Church to notice the signs of the times and to take advantage of opportunities to teach, preach, and seek conversions. The Church shines brilliantly to the whole world and advances in holiness during the 2040&#8217;s A.D. The green figs represent those who are immature in the Faith, who now have opportunity, in the Church, to advance in holiness.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="16">
      <content>He refers to her as being like a dove and he uses the feminine form &#8216;decora.&#8217; She is hidden, but he hears and recognizes her voice. He can find her.
&lt;br&gt;
+The dove is the faithful of the Church, who are sheltered by the teachings and Sacraments of Christ and his Church, led by the Pope, the successor of Peter (the rock). Christ exhorts the Church to continue speaking to Christ in prayer, even when it is persecuted and must find shelter in the clefts of the rock. Christ admires the spiritual beauty and grace of the Church.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="17">
      <content>The chorus asks the Groom and Bride to help them with their vineyard.
&lt;br&gt;
+The faithful, even those not mature in faith, appeal to Christ and His Bride the Church to help with problems in the vineyard of the Faith. The little foxes are those who would harm or trouble the Church and those who are seeking faith in the Church.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="18">
      <content>She speaks about him using the masculine &#8216;dilectus&#8217;. She again mentions, as in a previous verse, that he pastures among lilies until midday.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ became Incarnate for His Church, and the Church was created for Christ. He finds rest and enjoyment in the flowers of the Church, in those who are faithful to Him and merciful to His people. As Christ pastures his flock, truth and goodness rise up like the sun, causing the shadows of sin and selfishness to decline. This is the answer to the request for help with the foxes of the vineyard: be for Christ and let him be for you; be pastured by him among the lilies of the Church (i.e. the Saints).</content>
    </note>
    <note num="19">
      <content>She calls him by the masculine &#8216;dilecte&#8217; and she again compares him to the doe and stag. She speaks as if to him, even though he is absent.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church prays for the Return of Christ.</content>

      <content>She uses the masculine &#8216;quem&#8217; and &#8216;illum&#8217;, so this is her speaking to him.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church seeks knowledge of Christ, but Christ is greater than the ability of the Church to understand Him, so He always remains partly unknown to the Church. Christ is ineffable, even to Mary and to the Church.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content>She uses the masculine &#8216;quem&#8217; and &#8216;illum&#8217;. She continues from the previous verse.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church does not always succeed, in the short term, in finding the whole truth about Christ; she must seek and not find for a time, just as the Apostles fished all night and caught nothing, until Christ arrived.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content> She continues from the previous verse. The word &#8216;vigiles&#8217; is rendered &#8216;watchers&#8217; rather than &#8216;watchmen&#8217; because, in one level of meaning, the watchers are the holy Angels.
&lt;br&gt;
+ The Church seeks help from the holy Angels, for they also know and follow the Christ. Even the holy Angels do not completely comprehend the mysteries of Christ.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="4">
      <content>She uses the masculine &#8216;quem&#8217;, &#8216;eum&#8217;, and &#8216;illum.&#8217; She continues from the previous verse. Therefore, this is the Bride speaking again.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church, in seeking further insights about Christ, is allowed to seek for a time before finding; once the Church finds a truth about Christ, it holds that truth and does not let it go. The Virgin Mary, mother of the Church, assists us in holding on to Christ and to the truths of His teaching.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="5">
      <content>Now he is speaking again to her peers, the daughters of Jerusalem, and he refers to her as &#8216;ipsa&#8217; in the feminine, therefore, this is the groom speaking.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ speaks to those who are daughters of the Church, asking them not to trouble the Church. The Church sometimes appears to be at rest or asleep. The Church rests in Christ. The Church also sleeps in the sense of sometimes being unresponsive.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="6">
      <content>This cannot be the bride speaking, because she would speak about herself in the first person. And it cannot be the groom, because he is more knowledgeable about his bride than the chorus. So it must be the chorus, inquiring so as to understand the bride even better.
&lt;br&gt;
+Now the daughters of Jerusalem answer the groom. He says don&#8217;t wake her, and they reply, asking for more information about her. This represents those who are new to the Faith, or immature in the Faith, or who have not yet joined the Church, asking for help in their understanding of the Church and of Mary.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="7">
      <content>After asking about the bride to be, the chorus notes that Solomon is disquieted on his bed, despite being surrounded by many soldiers, because he is anxious for her to arrive. Who is she who can disquiet a king?
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ (represented by Solomon, the groom) is anxious for the arrival of the Church, on her pilgrim journey to Heaven. The Chorus, in seeking knowledge of the Church and of Mary are led to inquire about God the Father.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="8">
      <content>There are four watches to the night, so the 60 soldiers guarding Solomon served 15 soldiers for each watch of the night. The daughters of Jerusalem note that all the worldly power of Solomon does not prevent one from fears in the night. This is a continuation of the previous question &#8216;who is she&#8217;? In other words, who is she who can disquiet the king on his bed? So this must be the chorus speaking.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church is anxious for the eventual Return of the Christ, who returns in the fourth watch of the night. No amount of money or weapons can protect the Church from her time of suffering prior to Christ&#8217;s Return.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="9">
      <content>The Chorus asks the bride about the groom, noting he is disquiet on his bed. The bride replies to the Chorus, speaking about the dignity of Solomon on his throne. She understands him better than the chorus, so they are the one&#8217;s inquiring and she is the one answering. The phrasing &#8216;portable throne&#8217; is from the original Douai Bible.
&lt;br&gt;
+God instructed the Israelites to make a portable tabernacle for the arc of the testimony, like a portable throne for the glory of God. The Church answers the chorus (of those seeking Christ), telling them about the throne of Christ, who is God.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="10">
      <content> The middle was not just &#8216;stravit,&#8217; covered; it was &#8216;constravit,&#8217; well-covered. The prefix &#8216;con&#8217; intensifies the meaning of the word. It was well-covered, so that the daughters of Jerusalem would not see all of the king&#8217;s figure and desire him. The bride notes the chastity and charity of the king.
&lt;br&gt;
+The glory of God is not entirely accessible to the Church, for God is ineffable. Therefore, even to the whole Church, even to the Magisterium, even to the Blessed in Heaven, God is beyond complete human comprehension. God is always to some extent unknown and alone and unreachable, except to Himself. The Church teaches about the chastity and charity of the Christ.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="11">
      <content>Now the bride tells the daughters to go to the king to see him in person. She talks about his mother and his wedding day. This is the manner of speech of a woman: talking about his mother and the rejoicing of his heart at his espousal.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church says to those who wish to be espoused to Christ as the Church is espoused to Him, to consider the kingship of God, Christ&#8217;s Father, and the joy brought to those who unite themselves to the Church and to God.</content>

      <content>The groom describes his bride using the metaphor of a fortress of war.
&lt;br&gt;
+This image of the tower with a thousand shields is cited in Ineffabilis Deus as a symbolism describing the Virgin Mary, therefore, this is the groom describing the bride. Her strength is from God and is found in God, so she is like an impregnable in her holiness and faith. Also, the neck is what supports the head, and the Church herself supports its head (the Pope leading the Bishops) with the strength and fortitude of a fortress of war.</content>

      <content>The word spouse (&#8216;sponsa&#8217;) is feminine, so this is the groom speaking about his bride. The groom will exalt his humble bride, who formerly tended to vineyards and was mistreated by her brothers; he will crown her near the tops of mountains, away from the habitations of men.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ calls his bride the Church to advance in holiness and in influence over the whole world. Many holy and devout Catholic Christians will live in Lebanon, the Middle East, and in northern Africa during the reign of the great monarch and the angelic shepherd. So many Christians will flock to the Holy Land to live there, in Israel, that the surrounding nations will become like the suburbs of Jerusalem, all the way through northern Africa and the Middle East, even though in those nations which are not now Christian and not now holy.</content>

      <content>The phrase &#8216;uno crine colli tui&#8217; does not literally refer to a hair growing out of her neck; rather it refers to a lock or tress of hair resting on her neck.
&lt;br&gt;
+The neck supports the head; the support that the faithful offer to the heads of the Church, to the Pope and the Bishops, wounds Christ&#8217;s heart with joy. The eyes of the Church are its teachings; the understanding and acceptance of Church teaching wounds Christ&#8217;s heart with joy.</content>

      <content>Aromatics are such because they contain various kinds of oils. The groom is extolling his brides exterior beauty, which is symbolic of her inner beauty.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ extols the beauty of His Church; the breasts of the Church are the belief and practice of the Faith; the breasts of the Church are its teachings from Tradition and Scripture, which the faithful see as beautiful and fragrant. The ointments of the Church are its teachings and Sacraments, which heal body and soul.</content>

      <content>The groom admires the words of his spouse (&#8216;sponsa&#8217;), using the metaphors of honey and milk. Even the fragrance of her garments is admirable, which indicates symbolically the extent of her inner beauty.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ admires the words of His Church; the words of the Church are sweet to the soul, and nourishing to the body, like honey and milk. The fragrance of the Church is Her prayers, for incense rises up to God like prayer.</content>

    <note num="12">
      <content>The groom extols the virginity and general faithfulness of his spouse; the garden of her body and her soul are pure and unspoiled.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Christ extols the virginity and faithfulness of the Virgin Mary, and also of the Church. Virginity is more than faithfulness in body, it is also faithfulness in soul.</content>

      <content>The phrase &#8216;malorum punicorum&#8217; refers to Punician &#8216;apples,&#8217; i.e. pomegranates. Again, the term &#8216;Cypri&#8217; in the context of fruits of a garden refers to Cypress grapes. (These grapes were valued above other grapes because of the renown of the vineyards and wines of Cyprus.) The word &#8216;nardo&#8217; is translated as &#8216;aromatic oil&#8217; because that plant was used to make aromatic oil, and because &#8216;nard&#8217; or &#8216;spikenard&#8217; is unrecognizable to most readers.

      <content>The trees of Lebanon produced some of the best wood of Biblical times. Ointments were used as perfumes, but also as remedies for various ailments.

      <content>The groom uses the metaphor of a well-watered garden to describe his bride. The term &#8216;living waters&#8217; refers to flowing clean water, as opposed to stagnant and contaminated water.
&lt;br&gt;
+The Church provides living waters to the faithful, beginning with their baptism, and continuing with all the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="16">
      <content>The groom uses this metaphor to say that he wants his bride to be appreciated for her inner and outer beauty far and wide, to the north and the south.

&lt;br&gt;
+ Christ arrived in the garden of this world at His Incarnation. He harvested the myrrh of His bitter Passion. He has bestowed the aromatic oil of the Sacrament of Holy Orders.

&lt;br&gt;
+In one sense, Christ is at the very doors of each person&#8217;s heart, accessible and ready to enter. In another sense, Christ is ineffable and unreachable, for no mere human person can understand fully the Son of God.

&lt;br&gt;
+The keepers of the walls are the secular authorities, who do not recognize the members of the Church as citizens of their city, but treat them like outsiders, as if they were a threat.

+ The religious and clergy of the Church are bound by their vows to Christ. They are bound by their vows to pray to him about the distress of the faithful, who languish in love for God. The faithful seek the help of the religious and clergy in finding Christ in their lives.</content>

      <content>His eyes are peaceful; they show his mildness and generosity. A number of Old Testament rituals involved &#8216;living waters,&#8217; i.e. running waters, similar to this verse.

      <content>The groom is compared to a garden of plants used to produce perfumes, incense, and medicinal remedies. Perfumers would prepare various ointments, which were healthful as well as fragrant.
&lt;br&gt;
+Myrrh symbolizes suffering, because it is bitter, and prayer because it is used in incense, which rises up toward the heavens like prayer. The Christ has lips of myrrh because he teaches us to pray and to accept sufferings.</content>

    <note num="16">
      <content>The word &#8216;tornatiles&#8217; refers to gold that has been worked, to smooth and shape it. The brides description of him is increasingly metaphorical, because as she considers what she knows about his exterior, she begins to understand his inner self increasingly well.
&lt;br&gt;
+Such is the way with the Church and the Christ. The Church considers all she knows about Christ and so attains to even further insights into His Divine and human natures.</content>

      <content>The cedars of Lebanon were once among the greatest forests in the known world. The wood of their cedars was among the finest wood in the world.

    <note num="18">
      <content>The bride realizes the depth of her love for the groom by meditating on his appearance and his inner qualities. She realizes he is both a friend and a love.
&lt;br&gt;
+Christ&#8217;s teachings are sweet to those who are sweet, and bitter to those who are bitter. His words console the heart and mind. He is the desired of nations. He is the friend of the faithful. Seek him and know him, if you would be a child of Jerusalem.</content>

    <note num="19">
      <content>After hearing her loving description of him, the chorus (maidens or adolescent girls) also begins to love him and seek him.

The quadrigas is a particular type of chariot, one with four horses, used in battle. The word &#8216;Nescivi&#8217; literally means &#8216;I did not know&#8217; (perfect tense), but here it is used to mean &#8216;I did not understand.&#8217; She is troubled because of a lack of understanding, not a lack of knowledge.
&lt;br&gt;
+ Amminadab means &#8216;the people of the prince.&#8217; The word represents the powers of secular society and the chariots of Amminadab represent the force used by secular law enforcement and secular military force. Amminadab was also the name of Aaron&#8217;s father-in-law, who, though he was related to Aaron, did not join in the Jewish faith, i.e. he remained apart from true religion. The Church is troubled by the secular society, which exerts force through military and law enforcement, yet which is not governed by faith.</content>

      <content>The chorus of maidens wishes to meditate upon the beauty of the bride. They ask her to return from examining the nearly inaccessible garden. They still seek further knowledge of the bride and groom, because they will eventually mature and become married themselves.
&lt;br&gt;
+Those not yet mature in the faith are becoming mature in the faith by seeking and contemplating the Bride of Christ. They want the Church to turn away from secular society, which causes the Church to be disturbed.</content>

      <content> In a previous verse, the maidens asked the bride to return, so that they can meditate on her beauty. Now the maidens expresses their meditation on the beauty of the bride. This is not the groom speaking, because he has already extolled her in much the same words. The maidens ask the groom what else he sees in the bride, so that they can understand her even better.
&lt;br&gt;
+The daughter of a ruler is the Church; also, it is the Virgin Mary. The ruler is God the Father. Notice that the Chorus, those newly seeking God in the Church, have now arrived at a similar understanding about the Church as that of the Groom (Christ). That is why this passage is the Chorus speaking; now they understand; before they did not understand. They are maturing in the Faith.</content>

      <content>The word &#8216;tornatilis&#8217; refers to something smoothed (perhaps on a lathe); the word &#8216;crater&#8217; is not so much a crater as a bowl. The word &#8216;poculis&#8217; can refer to a drink or to a cup, but in this context it refers to the curves of the bride&#8217;s abdomen. The word &#8216;navel&#8217; is used to represent the exposed abdomen; the sentence is not about the navel itself.
&lt;br&gt;

      <content>Cities are sometimes referred to as &#8216;daughters,&#8217; especially if it is a city related to another larger city, or if it is a set of cities in the same area. The daughter of the multitude is probably a city. The maidens continue their discourse on the beauty of the bride, now that they have learned about her from the groom. The eyes are the entrance to the soul, which is profound, like a city with a multitude of peoples.

The word &#8216;regis&#8217; is in the genitive singular, so the translation is &#8216;the purple of the king.&#8217; It is not the king who is bound (&#8216;vincta&#8217;), but the purple cloth of a king, which is bound into &#8216;canalibus,&#8217; i.e. pleats.

      <content>Dates are a common type of fruit from a palm tree. Now the groom is speaking about the bride, since he speaks about her breasts and since the person speaking is first person singular. The transition from the maidens speaking to the groom speaking is indicated by the introductory phrase: &#8216;I said....&#8217;
&lt;br&gt;
+Both the Christ and the Church are compare to the palm tree, because the Church is the Body of Christ. The Christ says that He will ascend to the palm tree, i.e. that He will ascend to the Church in Heaven, and that its fruit, the Blessed in Heaven, will benefit the Church on earth.</content>

This kind of compositional technique is common in Scripture. She calls him by the masculine &#8216;dilecto,&#8217; so this is the bride speaking to the groom.

      <content>This translation is similar to the original Douai translation of the text. The bride is saying that she discovered peace in the presence of the groom. So the peaceful one is the groom, Solomon. The vineyard is located in that place which held an abundant number of different peoples. This phrasing in Hebrew is possibly the name of a region, so named because of the abundance of different peoples.
&lt;br&gt;
+The peaceful one is Christ. His vineyard is the Church, which is located on earth, a place which holds many peoples. The caretakers are the succession of Popes and Bishops who rule the Church. The fruit of the Church is more valuable than that of any other vineyard. The peacefulness of Christ yields much fruit.</content>

    <note num="13">
      <content>Now the groom has returned to his vineyard. The fruit of its peacefulness is valuable, and those who cared for it were faithful.
&lt;br&gt;
The Christ will return to His vineyard on earth. Then there will be over a thousand years of peacefulness on earth, during which time the Church will continue to care for God&#8217;s people. (Perhaps the total time of peace on earth will be approx. 1200 years: the thousand for peace, plus the two hundred for the keepers of the vineyard.) But Christ does not reign in person during this time of peace.</content>
