      <content>The wisdom of many great things has been revealed to us through the law, and the prophets, and the other books that followed these. Concerning these things, Israel ought to be praised, because of doctrine and wisdom. For it is necessary, not only for those who are speaking, but even for outsiders, to be skillful, both in speaking and in writing, so as to become very learned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>My grandfather Jesus, after he gave himself fully to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books that were handed down to us by our ancestors, also wanted to write something himself, about the things that pertain to doctrine and wisdom, so that those who desire to learn and to become skillful in these things would be more and more attentive in mind, and would be strengthened to live according to the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And so, I exhort you to approach with benevolence, and to perform the reading with attentive study, and to be forbearing in these things when we may seem, while pursuing the image of wisdom, to fall short in the composition of words.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For the Hebrew words are deficient when they have been translated into another language.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And not only these words, but also the law itself, and the prophets, and the remainder of the books, have no small difference from when they have been spoken in their own language.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For in the time of king Ptolemy Euergetes, in the thirty-eighth year after I had arrived in Egypt, after I had been there for a long time, I found, left behind there, books with a doctrine neither small nor contemptible.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And so I considered it to be both good and necessary for me to apply some significant diligence and labor in order to translate this book.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then, after much attentiveness to doctrine over a length of time, I brought to a close the things being considered, so as to offer this book for those who are willing to apply their mind and to learn how they ought to conduct their way of life,</content>

      <content> In my humble considered opinion, this prologue is just as inspired and infallible as any and all chapters of Sacred Scripture.</content>

      <content> Notice that the first thing one should not have shame in is good (the law and the covenant), and the second thing is bad (unjust judgment). So there is a two-fold meaning: the type of shame where one feels shame in something that is actually good, wherein there is no reason for shame, and the type of shame which one feels shame for an immoral act, wherein there is reason for shame. Do not have shame in God&#8217;s covenant and in His law; follow the covenant and the law without shame. But then, do not have shame in unjust judgment by avoiding unjust judgment (not by doing it without shame).</content>

      <content> This passage is advice concerning how one&#8217;s young unmarried daughter should behave, in order to retain chastity. So, the verb was changed in translation to the third person singular, feminine, from the second person singular imperative. Looking at the attractiveness of every man is harmful to her chastity. So is spending time with married women, who might talk about marital relations, perhaps even in a crass manner.</content>

    <note num="3">
      <content> Iniquity pertaining to men, i.e. sins committed because of her attraction to a man, proceeds from a woman.

    <note num="5">
      <content> The sense of verse 14 is that even though the problems a daughter might encounter, which are warned against in verse 13, are harmful, there is a worse situation, that of married women influencing your daughter, leading her into confusion and disgrace. This passage is not saying that men's sins are better than women's sins. Rather, it is advice as to how to advise and govern a young unmarried daughter. If she hangs around older women, they might think to 'help' her by giving her advice about men which is not fitting to someone who is young and unmarried, so instead of benefiting her, they would lead her into confusion and disgrace. In other words, hanging around older married women might corrupt your virgin unmarried daughter, since they might talk about men in a licentious manner.</content>

      <content> The verb here is in the second person singular because the subject is represented by the pronoun &#8216;qui&#8217; (who). But using &#8216;who&#8217; in English when it is not a question is awkward, so the pronoun used in third person singular. Thus, &#8216;post te&#8217; becomes &#8216;after him&#8217;.</content>
