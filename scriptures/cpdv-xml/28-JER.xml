      <content> Some translations have changed this text, &#8216;the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim,&#8217; to read &#8216;the reign of Zedekiah,&#8217; perhaps because the translators or editors thought it was a manuscript error. But notice the next two verses indicate a gap in time. Verse 2 has the Lord telling Jeremiah to make bands and chains, and place them on his neck. Verse 3 then tells Jeremiah to send these to the various kings. Why would he put these things on his neck if the purpose was to send them to other nations? The answer is most probably that this section of text (in infallible Sacred Scripture) was based on a prior source (written or verbal, but not infallible) which had a longer story: Jeremiah put the bands and chains on his neck, then he went about preaching the word of the Lord, and, as the Old Testament prophets often did, he used this act of wearing bands and chains as a sign, a king of living parable, of his message. The message, of course, is that the Babylonian captivity was next to occur. Much later, during the reign of Zedekiah, he then sent bands and chains to the various kings as a prophetic act, anticipating the imminent captivity of the nations. So verse 1 is correct that all this began in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim.</content>

      <content> See Jeremiah chapter 52, verse 17, which refers to the &#8216;sea of brass&#8217; in the house of the Lord. This earlier reference, therefore, is not to a sea of water, but to a feature of the house of the Lord, a large area of brass figuratively called a &#8216;sea of brass.&#8217;</content>

This would be comparable to something more than house arrest, but less than full imprisonment. And so Jeremiah, from prison, was able to buy a piece of land, and sign and seal deeds, and have witnesses attest to the transaction.</content>

      <content>And then king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, reigned in place of Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim. For Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, appointed him as king in the land of Judah.</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>And neither he himself, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, obeyed the words of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah, the prophet.</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying: &#8220;Pray to the Lord our God for us.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now Jeremiah was walking freely in the midst of the people. For they had not yet sent him into the custody of the prison. And then the army of Pharaoh went forth from Egypt. And hearing this, the Chaldeans, who were besieging Jerusalem, withdrew from Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</content>

      <content>&#8220;Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: So shall you say to the king of Judah, who sent you to question me: Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which has gone forth in assistance to you, will return to their own land, into Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">

      <content>Thus says the Lord: Do not be willing to deceive your own souls, saying: &#8216;The Chaldeans will certainly withdraw and go away from us.&#8217; For they will not go away.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>But even if you were to strike down the entire army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and if there were left behind from among them only a few wounded men, they would rise up, each one from his tent, and they would burn this city with fire.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>Therefore, when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh&#8217;s army,</content>

      <content>And when he had arrived at the gate of Benjamin, the keeper of the gate, whose turn it was to be there, was named Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he apprehended Jeremiah the prophet, saying, &#8220;You are fleeing to the Chaldeans.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And Jeremiah responded: &#8220;That is false. I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans.&#8221; But he did not listen to him. And so Irijah took Jeremiah, and he brought him to the leaders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Therefore, the leaders were angry with Jeremiah, and so they beat him and sent him to the prison that was in the house of Jonathan, the scribe. For he was the chief over the prison.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And so Jeremiah went into the house of the prison and into a dungeon. And Jeremiah sat there for many days.</content>

      <content>Then Zedekiah the king, sending, took him out and questioned him secretly in his house, and he said: &#8220;Do you think that there is any word from the Lord?&#8221; And Jeremiah said: &#8220;There is.&#8221; And he said: &#8220;You will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah: &#8220;How have I sinned against you, or your servants, or your people, such that you would cast me into a house of imprisonment?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Where are your prophets, who were prophesying to you, and who were saying: &#8216;The king of Babylon will not overwhelm you and this land?&#8217;</content>

      <content>Now therefore, listen, I beg you, my lord the king. Let my petition prevail in your sight. And do not send me back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>Then king Zedekiah instructed that Jeremiah be confined to the vestibule of the prison, and that they should give him a twist of bread daily, along with stew, until all the bread in the city had been consumed. And Jeremiah remained at the entrance of the prison.</content>

      <content>Then Shephatiah, the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah, the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>&#8220;Thus says the Lord: Whoever will remain in this city will die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence. But whoever will flee away from the Chaldeans, will live, and his soul will dwell in safety.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And the leaders said to the king: &#8220;We petition you to put this man to death.

For this man is certainly not seeking peace for this people, but evil.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Therefore, they took Jeremiah and cast him into the pit of Malchiah, the son of Amelech, which was at the entrance to the prison. And they lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the pit, in which there was no water, but only mud. And so Jeremiah descended into the mire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now Ebedmelech, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch who was in the king&#8217;s house, heard that they had sent Jeremiah into the pit, and also that the king was sitting at the gate of Benjamin.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>&#8220;My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have perpetrated against Jeremiah the prophet, casting him into the pit so that he would die there from famine. For there is no more bread in the city.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">

      <content>Therefore, Ebedmelech, taking the men with him, entered into the king&#8217;s house to a place below the storehouse. And he took from there old garments, no longer in use, and he sent them down by rope to Jeremiah in the pit.</content>
