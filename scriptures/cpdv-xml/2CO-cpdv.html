<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all of Achaia:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He consoles us in all our tribulation, so that we too may be able to console those who are in any kind of distress, through the exhortation by which we also are being exhorted by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For just as the Passion of Christ abounds in us, so also, through Christ, does our consolation abound.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So, if we are in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation, or if we are in consolation, it is for your consolation, or if we are exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which results in the patient endurance of the same passion which we also endure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So may our hope for you be made firm, knowing that, just as you are participants in the suffering, so also shall you be participants in the consolation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our tribulation, which happened to us in Asia. For we were weighed down beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we became weary, even of life itself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we had within ourselves the response to death, so that we would not have faith in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He has rescued us, and he is rescuing us, from great peril. In him, we hope that he will continue to rescue us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And you are assisting, with your prayers for us, so that from many persons, by that which is a gift in us, thanks may be given through many persons, because of us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For our glory is this: the testimony of our conscience, which is found in simplicity of heart and in sincerity toward God. And it is not with worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God, that we have conversed with this world, and more abundantly toward you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For we write nothing else to you other than what you have read and understood. And I hope that you will continue to understand, even unto the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And just as you have acknowledged us in our role, that we are your glory, so also you are ours, unto the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And with this confidence, I wanted to come to you sooner, so that you might have a second grace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and through you to pass into Macedonia, and to return to you again from Macedonia, and so be led by you on my way to Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then, although I had intended this, did I act lightly? Or in the things that I consider, do I consider according to the flesh, so that there would be, with me, both Yes and No?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But God is faithful, so our word, which was set before you, was not, in him, both Yes and No.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through myself and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not Yes, and No; but was simply Yes in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For whatever promises are of God are, in him, Yes. For this reason, too, through him: Amen to God for our glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now the One who confirms us with you in Christ, and who has anointed us, is God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he has sealed us, and he has placed the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But I call God as a witness to my soul, that I was lenient with you, in that I did not return to Corinth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>not because we have dominion over your faith, but because we are assistants of your joy. For by faith you stand.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-27-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The verb ‘cognovistis’ in this context has more of the meaning ‘to acknowledge’ or ‘to recognize,’ rather than to know a fact or a person. The phrase ‘ex parte,’ which occurs several times in this passage, is somewhat idiomatic, indicating someone’s role, as in the expressions ‘for my part’ or ‘in my role.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But I determined this within myself, not to return again to you in sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is it that can make me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And so, I wrote this same thing to you, so that I might not, when I arrive, add sorrow to sorrow for those with whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you in all things, so that my joy may be entirely yours.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For with much tribulation and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not so that you would be sorrowful, but so that you might know the charity that I have more abundantly toward you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if anyone has brought sorrow, he has not sorrowed me. Yet, for my part, this is so that I might not burden all of you.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let this rebuke be sufficient for someone like this, for it has been brought by many.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So then, to the contrary, you should be more forgiving and consoling, lest perhaps someone like this may be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Because of this, I beg you to confirm your charity toward him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>It was for this reason, also, that I wrote, so that I might know, by testing you, whether you would be obedient in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But anyone whom you have forgiven of anything, I also forgive. And then, too, anyone I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it was done in the person of Christ for your sakes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>so that we would not be circumvented by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his intentions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when I had arrived at Troas, because of the Gospel of Christ, and a door had opened to me in the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I had no rest within my spirit, because I was not able to find Titus, my brother. So, saying goodbye to them, I set out for Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But thanks be to God, who always brings triumph to us in Christ Jesus, and who manifests the fragrance of his knowledge through us in every place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ for God, both with those who are being saved and with those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To the one, certainly, the fragrance is of death unto death. But to the other, the fragrance is of life unto life. And concerning these things, who is so suitable?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For we are not like many others, adulterating the Word of God. But instead, we speak with sincerity: from God, before God, and in Christ.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-47-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The Latin verb ‘contristavit’ is intransitive in the first part of the verse, but this makes the English phrasing somewhat awkward, ‘If anyone has sorrowed [no object], he has not sorrowed me.’ So the phrasing ‘has brought sorrow’ is used.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Must we begin again to commend ourselves? Or are we in need (as some are) of epistles of commendation for you, or from you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>You are our Epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>It has been made manifest that you are the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written down, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, and not on tablets of stone, but on the fleshly tablets of the heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And we have such faith, through Christ, toward God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>It is not that we are adequate to think anything of ourselves, as if anything was from us. But our adequacy is from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he has made us suitable ministers of the New Testament, not in the letter, but in the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But if the ministration of death, engraved with letters upon stones, was in glory, (so much so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze intently upon the face of Moses, because of the glory of his countenance) even though this ministration was ineffective,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>how could the ministration of the Spirit not be in greater glory?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For if the ministration of condemnation is with glory, so much more is the ministration of justice abundant in glory.</span></div>

The word impudicitia can refer to serious sexual immorality in general, but it often is used to refer to homosexuality. Since the other words in this list refer more generally to sexual immorality, this word must refer to the more specific sin of homosexuality (otherwise the word would be redundant and unnecessary to the sentence). Notice the progression in this list of offenses: first inner sexual sins, then fornication, then a more serious type of fornication, homosexuality.</span></div>
