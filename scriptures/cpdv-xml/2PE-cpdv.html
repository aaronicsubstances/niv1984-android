<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>2 Peter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Simon Peter, servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted an equal faith with us in the justice of our God and in our Savior Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace to you. And may peace be fulfilled according to the plan of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>in the same manner that all things which are for life and piety have been given to us by his Divine virtue, through the plan of him who has called us to our own glory and virtue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Through Christ, he has given us the greatest and most precious promises, so that by these things you may become sharers in the Divine Nature, fleeing from the corruption of that desire which is in the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But as for you, taking up every concern, minister virtue in your faith; and in virtue, knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and in knowledge, moderation; and in moderation, patience; and in patience, piety;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and in piety, love of brotherhood; and in love of brotherhood, charity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For if these things are with you, and if they abound, they will cause you to be neither empty, nor without fruit, within the plan of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For he who does not have these things at hand is blind and groping, being forgetful of his purification from his former offenses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Because of this, brothers, be all the more diligent, so that by good works you may make certain your calling and election. For in doing these things, you do not sin at any time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For in this way, you shall be provided abundantly with an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For this reason, I will always begin to admonish you about these things, even though, certainly, you know them and are confirmed in the present truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But I consider it just, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up with admonishments.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For it is certain that the laying to rest of this, my tabernacle, is approaching swiftly, just as our Lord Jesus Christ has also indicated to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, I will present a work for you to have, so that, frequently after my passing, you may call to mind these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For it was not by following fanciful doctrines that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were made eyewitnesses of his greatness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For he received honor and glory from God the Father, whose voice descended to him from the magnificent glory: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>We also heard this voice conveyed from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And so, we have an even firmer prophetic word, to which you would do well to listen, as to a light shining within a dark place, until the day dawns, and the daystar rises, in your hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Understand this first: that every prophecy of Scripture does not result from one’s own interpretation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For prophecy was not conveyed by human will at any time. Instead, holy men were speaking about God while inspired by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-25-2'>2 Peter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be among you lying teachers, who will introduce divisions of perdition, and they will deny him who bought them, the Lord, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And many persons will follow their indulgences; through such persons, the way of truth will be blasphemed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And in avarice, they will negotiate about you with false words. Their judgment, in the near future, is not delayed, and their perdition does not sleep.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For God did not spare those Angels who sinned, but instead delivered them, as if dragged down by infernal ropes, into the torments of the underworld, to be reserved unto judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he did not spare the original world, but he preserved the eighth one, Noah, the herald of justice, bringing the flood upon the world of the impious.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-2" id="cpdv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, condemning them to be overthrown, setting them as an example to anyone who might act impiously.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he rescued a just man, Lot, who was oppressed by the unjust and lewd behavior of the wicked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For in seeing and in hearing, he was just, though he lived with those who, from day to day, crucified the just soul with works of iniquity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Thus, the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trials, and how to reserve the iniquitous for torments on the day of judgment;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>even more so, those who walk after the flesh in unclean desires, and who despise proper authority. Boldly pleasing themselves, they do not dread to introduce divisions by blaspheming;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>whereas the Angels, who are greater in strength and virtue, did not bring against themselves such a deplorable judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Yet truly, these others, like irrational beasts, naturally fall into traps and into ruin by blaspheming whatever they do not understand, and so they shall perish in their corruption,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>receiving the reward of injustice, the fruition of valuing the delights of the day: defilements and stains, overflowing with self-indulgences, taking pleasure in their feasts with you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>having eyes full of adultery and of incessant offenses, luring unstable souls, having a heart well-trained in avarice, sons of curses!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Abandoning the straight path, they wandered astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of iniquity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Yet truly, he had a correction of his madness: the mute animal under the yoke, which, by speaking with a human voice, forbid the folly of the prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>These ones are like fountains without water, and like clouds stirred up by whirlwinds. For them, the mist of darkness is reserved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For, speaking with the arrogance of vanity, they lure, by the desires of fleshly pleasures, those who are fleeing to some extent, who are being turned from error,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>promising them freedoms, while they themselves are the servants of corruption. For by whatever a man is overcome, of this also is he the servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For if, after taking refuge from the defilements of the world in the understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again become entangled and overcome by these things, then the latter state becomes worse than the former.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of justice than, after acknowledging it, to turn away from that holy commandment which was handed on to them.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-3" id="cpdv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For the truth of the proverb has happened to them: The dog has returned to his own vomit, and the washed sow has returned to her wallowing in the mud.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The phrase ‘iam olim’ has the effect of referring to the near future: ‘iam’ (now or already), and ‘olim’ (referring to the past or to the future).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their three wives, (8 persons) were saved on the ark. Also, there were 8 generations between Adam and Noah.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> Those who die in original sin only, being guilty of the mortal sin of omission of never having found sanctifying grace throughout their adult lives, are punished in Hell with lesser sufferings than those who found sanctifying grace, and later lost it, never to regain it again, because of mortal sins after sanctifying grace.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-52-3'>2 Peter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Consider, most beloved, this second epistle which I am writing to you, in which I stir up, by admonition, your sincere mind,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>so that you may be mindful of those words that I preached to you from the holy prophets, and of the precepts of the Apostles of your Lord and Savior.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Know this first: that in the last days there will arrive deceitful mockers, walking according to their own desires,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>saying: “Where is his promise or his advent? For from the time that the fathers have slept, all things have continued just as they were from the beginning of creation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But they willfully ignore this: that the heavens existed first, and that the earth, from water and through water, was established by the Word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>By water, the former world then, having been inundated with water, perished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But the heavens and the earth that exist now were restored by the same Word, being reserved unto fire on the day of judgment, and unto the perdition of impious men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Yet truly, let this one thing not escape notice, most beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like one day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The Lord is not delaying his promise, as some imagine, but he does act patiently for your sake, not wanting anyone to perish, but wanting all to be turned back to penance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the day of the Lord shall arrive like a thief. On that day, the heavens shall pass away with great violence, and truly the elements shall be dissolved with heat; then the earth, and the works that are within it, shall be completely burned up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what kind of people ought you to be? In behavior and in piety, be holy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>waiting for, and hurrying toward, the advent of the day of the Lord, by which the burning heavens shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt from the heat of the fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Yet truly, in accord with his promises, we are looking forward to the new heavens and the new earth, in which justice lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, most beloved, while awaiting these things, be diligent, so that you may be found to be immaculate and unassailable before him, in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And let the longsuffering of our Lord be considered salvation, as also our most beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>just as he also spoke in all of his epistles about these things. In these, there are certain things which are difficult to understand, which the unlearned and the unsteady distort, as they also do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But since you, brothers, know these things beforehand, be cautious, lest by being drawn into the error of the foolish, you may fall away from your own steadfastness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Yet truly, increase in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory, both now and in the day of eternity. Amen.</span></div>
