      <content> The word &#8216;arcum&#8217; can refer to a bow (a weapon used in battle) or to a citadel or stronghold. In this case, the nation of Israel could be said to have a metaphorical bow (strength in battle), but the translation of &#8216;stronghold&#8217; is more fitting when the possessor of the &#8216;arcum&#8217; is a nation, not an individual.</content>

      <content> The one head placed over Israel and Judah refers to one Pope set over all Christians. This verse refers to the future unification of all Christians in one Catholic Church. The phrase &#8216;ponet sibi met&#8217; can also be translated as &#8216;appoint to harvest (or to reap) themselves,&#8217; or, perhaps, &#8216;appoint to measure (i.e. govern and judge) themselves.&#8217;</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;egressus&#8217; usually means &#8216;departure&#8217; or &#8216;going forth,&#8217; but in this case, the context is that of the arrival of the Lord.

      <content> Or, &#8216;having been tripped up by blood.&#8217; The meaning here is that the city fell into the error of manufacturing idols because of blood-relations, i.e. family relations. Individuals, in that time period, tended to take up whatever was the family business; the same was also true of some towns. If a town had a specialized product or service, the people of the town tended to go into that line of work (e.g. Tyrian purple, the city of Tyre specialized in making dyes).</content>

      <content> Literally, &#8216;quasi fauces virorum latronum&#8217; means &#8216;like the jaws of men robbers.&#8217; The word &#8216;virorum&#8217; means &#8216;men,&#8217; but it has an additional connotation of a man who is virtuous or strong. In the context of robbers, the meaning is &#8216;strong robbers.&#8217; But the strength of a robber&#8217;s jaw does not help him rob, unless his strength is in the skillful use of words. So, less literally, the phase says, &#8216;like the jaws of skillful robbers.&#8217; But again, the passage is not literally taking about the jaws (or throats) of robbers. Criminals do not rob by using their jaws, unless it is the type of robber who tricks people with words. The comparison here is with those who are con-artists, who rob people by deceiving them with words.</content>

      <content> Those called &#8216;particeps sacerdotum&#8217; are not the priests themselves, but they are associates of the priests. These pastoral associates are not actually murdering people in the streets. Such a long complex sentence would not be needed to condemn such a public crime. Also, the word &#8216;interficientium&#8217; typically refers to killing under authority, such as an execution by a king, or under the law, or by God. So these persons, working with the priests, influence travelers on a journey so that they deserve a death sentence from God. In other words, they lead people astray with their words. The context is religious, and so the journey is translated as a pilgrimage.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;coetus&#8217; can refer to various types of meetings: social, political, sexual, etc. The word auditionem refers to a report or the result of a meeting, such as an agreement or ruling. The phrase &#8216;secundum auditionem c&#339;tus eorum&#8217; is translated in the context of God&#8217;s objection to the people going to Egypt and Assyria for assistance and meetings and agreements. Therefore, the meaning and translation is political. God objects when the faithful seek safety from meetings and agreements with secular groups, rather than seeking help and safety from God.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;absconditum&#8217; usually is translated as &#8216;hidden.&#8217; But, in this context, Ephraim&#8217;s sins are not hidden from view, rather, he is being restrained because of his sins. Therefore, the translation is &#8216;engulfed&#8217; rather than &#8216;hidden.&#8217; Context is so important to translation that the same word in Latin cannot be always translated, in any context, by the same corresponding word in English.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content> Here is another play on words in Latin. Death is &#8216;mors&#8217; and bite is &#8216;morsus.&#8217; This play on words ought to survive the translation. Since the &#8216;bite&#8217; refers to the &#8216;bite of death,&#8217; the translation of &#8216;mortal wound&#8217; or &#8216;deadly wound&#8217; is justified. Note that &#8216;inferne&#8217; is often translated as &#8216;Hell,&#8217; but it usually does not specifically refer to that place where souls are punished forever. It has a more general meaning, like &#8216;underworld,&#8217; or &#8216;afterlife.&#8217; In this case, God is freeing people from the bite of death. Hellfire is the bite of death and a deadly wound.</content>

      <content> This word &#8216;venas&#8217; usually means &#8216;blood vessels&#8217; or &#8216;fissures&#8217; in the ground (e.g. veins of silver). But in this context it refers to veins of water, such as streams or springs. The next phrase uses &#8216;fontem&#8217; to refer to springs, so the previous phrase is rendered &#8216;streams.&#8217; In the last phrase, a very literal translations would be: &#8216;he will tear apart the treasure chest of every desirable vessel.&#8217; However, &#8216;thesaurum&#8217; does not always mean &#8216;treasure.&#8217; It can also refer to any collection of valuable things, as in this phrase where the valuable things are &#8216;vasis desiderabilis,&#8217; i.e. useful equipment or desirable useful things. The word order is changed so that the phrase sounds better in English, from &#8216;collections of every desirable useful thing,&#8217; to &#8216;every collection of desirable useful things.&#8217;</content>
