      <content> The way this is phrased in the Latin leaves open the possibility that Amos was not himself so much a shepherd as a shepherd&#8217;s helper. He was &#8216;among&#8217; or &#8216;with&#8217; the shepherds of Tekoa.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;trituraverint&#8217; means to thresh grain during a harvest. They have threshed or harvested the people of Gilead into iron wagons, i.e. they have harvested them and contained them (implying harshness and some form of captivity or restraint).</content>

    <note num="3">
      <content> The word &#8216;disperdam&#8217; means &#8216;to destroy&#8217; or &#8216;to utterly ruin&#8217; or &#8216;to cause great loss.&#8217;</content>
    </note>
    <note num="4">
      <content> This phrase can be rendered as &#8216;an excellent captivity,&#8217; or &#8216;a complete captivity,&#8217; or even &#8216;a perfect captivity.&#8217; Note that the word &#8216;sceleribus&#8217; has a strong meaning, perhaps better translated as &#8216;wicked deeds,&#8217; than as merely &#8216;crimes.&#8217; It also has the connotation, especially in this context, of sinfulness.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="5">
      <content> Literally, this last phrase says, &#8216;and they have not been thinking of the pact of brothers.&#8217; But, from the context, this is not a formal written agreement; it refers to the unspoken alliance or bond among those who are of the same family, or the same nation, or one and the same human race.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="6">
      <content> In the Latin, you can see that &#8216;suum&#8217; refers to Edom, but &#8216;ejus&#8217; refers to his brother. This would not be apparent in English unless &#8216;ejus&#8217; is translated loosely as &#8216;his brother,&#8217; rather than as merely &#8216;his.&#8217;</content>
    </note>
    <note num="7">
      <content> Literally, &#8216;tenuerit ultra furorem suum&#8217; is &#8216;he has kept beyond his anger.&#8217; But in this context it refers to going beyond the limits of one&#8217;s anger. Notice how this plays into the next verse, &#8216;usque in finem.&#8217; He goes beyond the limits of his anger and he holds onto his anger until the limit.</content>

But, in this context, wherein they are giving a command to their &#8216;dominis,&#8217; to serve them, it refers to aristocrats or nobles or other types of leaders (perhaps even religious leaders), who ought to be in a role of leadership, but who are made to serve these sinners instead.</content>

      <content> The pronoun &#8216;eo&#8217; appears twice in this verse. Each time it refers to the same person. It could be interpreted to refer to God. So, they have torn apart the poor and they have stolen choice prey from God. The poor are the choice prize valued by God. The prior verse also refers to God, making this interpretation likely. On the other hand, the &#8216;pro eo&#8217; could also refer to the poor, on whose behalf God punishes those who act unjustly.</content>

      <content> The expression &#8216;the Lord God of hosts&#8217; could also be rendered &#8216;the Lord God of armies,&#8217; that is, of armies that destroy those who do evil and do not repent. The remnant of Joseph is the small number of believers who continue in the faith during a time when the vast majority of the world&#8217;s inhabitants have given themselves over to doing evil.</content>

      <content> This last expression is obscure and could have several different possible meanings. The translation is phrased to leave open multiple possible interpretations. He could be asking if any persons are still left &#8216;penes,&#8217; i.e. &#8216;under his power.&#8217; Or, he could be asking if there is anything valuable, such as food, left in the house. The man who is in the inner most room of the house has locked himself in, but he cannot prevent the intruder from taking all his possessions and perhaps his loved ones as well.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;Numquid&#8217; introduces a question whose answer is in the negative. But the speaker in this quote (following &#8216;qui dicitis&#8217;) clearly expects the answer to be &#8216;yes.&#8217; The reason, then, that Numquid is still used is that the one presenting the quote, God, is saying that the true answer is &#8216;no.&#8217; So, the sinners say, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t we done all this by our own strength?&#8217; They think the answer is &#8216;yes.&#8217; But God quotes them and their attitude using the word, &#8216;Numquid&#8217; because the truth is that they have not done these things by their own strength. Everything they have is from God.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;tonsionem&#8217; can refer to a mowing or clipping (of crops), or it can refer to thunder. Both meanings fit this context. Thunder is associated with rains, the king being God himself. And a king taking part of a harvest fits with the theme of planting before the rains. The meaning that refers to God is more universal, so it is favored over the alternate reading of this text.</content>

      <content> The last part of this verse is eloquent and sweeping, until the last word: &#8220;and it devoured the manifold abyss and it consumed simultaneously a part.&#8221; The word a part does not fit the context. Other possible translations of partem also are equally incongruous to the meaning of the verse. Now &#8216;partem&#8217; by itself can also mean &#8216;direction.&#8217; But pair &#8216;partem&#8217; with &#8216;simul&#8217; and its meaning takes on a new dimension: &#8220;and it devoured the manifold abyss and it consumed simultaneously in every direction.&#8221; Now I know that the word &#8216;every&#8217; in the English translation does not have a counterpart in the Latin, but this phrasing is necessary in order to prevent the loss of meaning of this text. The two words &#8216;partem&#8217; and &#8216;simul&#8217; have a greater meaning when used together than when each is alone. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</content>

The word &#8216;destroy&#8217; is overused in English translations of the Old Testament, and &#8216;wipe&#8217; is a more eloquent fit, so &#8216;wipe&#8217; is preferred over &#8216;destroy&#8217; in the other two instances.</content>
