      <content> &#8216;Auditum&#8217; is a report or a message or, more literally, something that has been heard. In this verse, the Lord sends an envoy or messenger (or even a message) to the nations to rise up against Edom.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;extulit&#8217; means to lift up or to carry, but it can also refer to the process of lifting up and carrying someone to burial, which is an appropriate subtext for this passage of strong rebuke from the Lord.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content> The word &#8216;conticuisses&#8217; does not mean to remain silent, but to go unnoticed. In other words, how would you have avoided being robbed by going unnoticed by the robbers? You cannot go unnoticed if you have exalted yourself.</content>

      <content> In this Latin sentence, the question is found in the first part and the answer in the second part. But the question mark is placed at the end of the sentence in other editions of this Latin text: &#8216;Quomodo scrutati sunt Esau, investigaverunt abscondita eius?&#8217; This is merely a peculiarity of Latin, it does not indicate that both parts of the sentence are questions.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;viri&#8217; in this context does not merely mean men, but the men who are leaders.</content>

      <content> In my interpretation, Meridian refers to most of Africa (but not the northern part that becomes part of the great monarch&#8217;s kingdom).</content>

      <content> The phrase &#8216;peribis in &#230;ternum&#8217; could be translated as &#8216;perish forever.&#8217; But it does not necessarily mean that those who perish go to Hell. The phrase &#8216;in &#230;ternum&#8217; tends to suggest the eternity of Heaven. Thus, those who pass away because of these offences are still worthy enough for eternal life.</content>

    <note num="8">
      <content> The word &#8216;absorbebunt&#8217; can be translated as &#8216;absorb&#8217; or &#8216;take in&#8217; or &#8216;engulf&#8217; or &#8216;swallow.&#8217;</content>
    </note>
    <note num="9">
      <content> The use of the plural for &#8216;salvatores&#8217; indicates that it does not refer to the Messiah (the one true Savior), but to those who follow and imitate the Savior, who do his will, and so who are properly referred to as saviors.</content>
