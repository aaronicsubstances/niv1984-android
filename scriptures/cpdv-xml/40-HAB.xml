      <content> The phrase &#8216;iniquitatem terr&#230; civitatis&#8217; refers to the iniquity of the community of earth. The word &#8216;civitatis&#8217; does not always refer to a particular city; it can also refer to a larger community, in this case the whole world. The context of the whole world is made clear in the previous verses, that refer to &#8216;all nations&#8217; and &#8216;all peoples.&#8217;</content>

      <content> This translation eschews the so-called &#8216;inclusive language&#8217; approach to translation. However, in this verse, it would be misleading to choose between &#8216;he&#8217; and &#8216;she&#8217; for the pronouns as the meaning of the text clearly applies to both or either genders. Thus, the word &#8216;their&#8217; is used in the singular.</content>
