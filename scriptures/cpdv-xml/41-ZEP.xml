      <content> The word &#8216;disperdam&#8217; usually means &#8216;to destroy&#8217; or &#8216;to bring to ruin&#8217; or &#8216;to do away with&#8217; something. However, the prefix &#8216;dis&#8217; means to separate or to scatter, and the root of the word, &#8216;perdo&#8217; means &#8216;to lose&#8217; something. In the context of all men on the face of the earth, it cannot be taken to mean &#8216;destroy,&#8217; but rather &#8216;scatter&#8217; or &#8216;disperse&#8217; before the face of the earth. Also, &#8216;disperse&#8217; is contrasted with &#8216;gather.&#8217;</content>

      <content> Notice that both those who profess true religion and those who worship a false god are grouped together. They behave the same, so they are treated the same. The next verse informs us that the one has turned aside from following the Lord and the other has never sought Him.</content>

      <content> The verb &#8216;tribulabitur&#8217; refers to being pressed or squeezed, in some contexts to obtain tribute or payment, in other contexts to pay for ones offenses. It is related to the word referring to the tribulation. The strong does not necessarily refer only to those who are evil and strong, it can refer to those who think they are strong in the faith; they will be tested in the time of the tribulation, to see if their strength is truly based on the Lord.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;consummation&#8217; brings to mind the words of Christ on the Cross, in Latin, &#8216;consummatum est,&#8217; or &#8216;it is completed.&#8217; The word &#8216;completion&#8217; does not quite do justice to the Latin word.</content>

      <content> &#8216;Speciosam&#8217; is capitalized after the Vercellone 1861 edition of the Vulgate, and because it clearly is used, as if a name, to refer to something specific. It could also, in this context, be loosely translated as &#8216;what was once called Beautiful,&#8217; or, &#8216;the so-called Beautiful,&#8217; since it is clear from subsequent verses that this place was not beautiful to God.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;provocatrix&#8217; refers to a female who provokes or instigates trouble. The term as used in this verse does not merely refer to the city (the word for which happens to be feminine in Latin). Rather, it refers to a particular woman who provokes trouble for the people of God. The provocatrix and the city that thinks itself to be redeemed are two separate, but related things. The provocatrix is the false prophet who assists the Antichrist (Assur). The city is a city that thinks itself redeemed by being favored by the false prophet. The name of the city is a name that means &#8216;dove.&#8217; Perhaps this word should be capitalized.</content>
