      <content> The cases of the words &#8216;patres vestros iracundia&#8217; do not match the cases of the corresponding words in translation because English grammar expresses this meaning in a different way. In English, &#8216;of your fathers&#8217; would seen to be a translation of the genitive case, but in Latin the fathers are the object of the verb referring to anger, so the case is accusative.</content>

      <content> The 70th year, in the context of Daniel&#8217;s 490 years, is the year 2018 A.D. The sufferings of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse occur from 2010 through 2018. The year 2019 is the 2000th anniversary of the Crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ (A.D. 19). In that year, 2019, the sufferings of the four horsemen (namely, World War 3, civil disorder and violence, the famine, and death from a variety of causes) will begin to quiet down. Then, from A.D. 2019 to 2023, these particular sufferings will diminish and end.</content>

      <content> The four horns are the four kingdoms into which the great monarch&#8217;s kingdom (established in A.D. 2040) will be divided (after his kingdom, in the latter part of the 21st century). These four are less holy than the great monarch&#8217;s kingdom, and they begin a continual decrease in holiness and wisdom, and a continual increase in sin and deceit, that finally, hundreds of years later, results in the kingdom of the Antichrist (the horn lifted over Judah).</content>

      <content> All the horses were strong, not merely the speckled ones. The symbolism of the horses is that of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. The white horses represent a war, ordained by God, in which a vast territory is conquered (World War 3). The red horses represent civil disorder and violence during the war. The black horses represent a famine. The speckled (varii) horses represent death from a variety of causes. There are four of each type of horse representing the four directions, for these events affect the whole world.</content>

Since the rising of the sun in the East is a fact known to all, this correspondence between Rising and East is not merely a coincidence of the Latin language. The man named &#8216;the Rising&#8217; or &#8216;the East&#8217; is the one often called &#8216;the Angelic Shepherd.&#8217; He is the Pope who is in office during the mid to late 2030&#8217;s (though his reign may begin earlier), and he has a long papacy lasting into the 2040&#8217;s and perhaps the 2050's.</content>

      <content> Notice that in Latin, the second and third of these four names are feminine (ending in &#8216;&#230;&#8217;). These four names represent the four leaders who rule after the great monarch, when his vast kingdom is divided into four parts. Two of the names are feminine because two of the four leaders will be women, even though it is contrary to God&#8217;s will for women to have such positions of leadership in society. The fourth name is the man who will rule over the kingdom of the South (Israel, the Middle East, Northern Africa), which is the southern-most part of the great monarch&#8217;s kingdom. He will be the holiest of the four leaders; his kingship is a memorial to the Temple of the Lord. He is called the &#8216;son of Zephaniah,&#8217; yet he is not the son of the great monarch. Rather, he is like the great monarch; he takes after him as a son takes after his father.</content>

      <content> The translation &#8216;visit&#8217; is somewhat awkward in English, but a less awkward translation would also be less accurate and would not convey the multiple levels of meaning of the term.

      <content> The word &#8216;Decorem&#8217; is masculine, so the translation is &#8216;Handsome,&#8217; rather than &#8216;Beautiful.&#8217; The one staff is beautiful, and the other one, Rope (or String, or Line), is useful. Now perhaps the first staff was handsome or beautiful in soul. So, the two staffs represent the contemplative life and the active life among religious and clergy.</content>

      <content> Some texts have the coins being tossed into a treasury, some towards a statuary. The spiritual meaning of this word may refer, not only to the price Judas Iscariot was paid to betray Christ, but to some future taxation by the administrative powers within the Church. God is angry at this event, but He directs the faithful to pay the tax. The treasury is the treasury of the Church; the statuary represents those leaders in the Church who are like statures, mere administrators or bureaucrats, lacking insight and compassion. Compare this to the story in the Gospels of the tax that Peter paid by catching a fish with a coin in its mouth.</content>

      <content> The women mourn separately because men and women are intended by God to have different roles, behaviors, and clothing: men and women are given separate places in the human family. On this day, this teaching will become clear to many, even if they do not realize it in words. The separateness is a separateness from society, since, on that day, there will be a silence from the noise of modern society. The separateness is also between different religions and denominations, for, at first, many people will seek refuge in their own religion. Later, Protestants will come to realize that they should unite with the Catholic Church. The separateness is a separateness of families that have been separated by distance, or by conflict. The separateness is an aloneness with God on that day for all who are truly devoted to God. Such is the Day of Repentance.</content>
