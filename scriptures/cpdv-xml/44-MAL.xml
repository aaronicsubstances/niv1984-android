      <content>But if Idumea will say, &#8220;We have been destroyed, but when we return, we will build up what has been destroyed,&#8221; thus says the Lord of hosts: They will build up, and I will destroy. And they will be called &#8220;The limits of impiety,&#8221; and, &#8220;The people with whom the Lord has been angry, even to eternity.&#8221;</content>

      <content>The son honors the father, and the servant his master. If, therefore, I am Father, where is my honor?

      <content>For, from the rising of the sun even to its setting, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place, a clean oblation is being sacrificed and offered to my name. For my name is great among the Gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>Cursed is the deceitful, who holds in his flock a male, and, when making a vow, offers in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord. For I am a great King, says the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;Nonne&#8217; gives both questions the connotation of &#8216;isn&#8217;t it true that....&#8217; Although the word &#8216;Nonne&#8217; is not repeated in Latin, the meaning applies to both and so it is, in effect, repeated in the translation.</content>

      <content> The blind, lame, and sick who are offered for sacrifice, in the Old Testament context, is the animals offered as sacrifice. But in the New Testament context, the blind, lame, and sick who are offered as a sacrifice to God are those who enter the priesthood or religious life, but who are unfit for such service due to spiritual blindness, lameness, or sickness.</content>

      <content>And you have said, &#8220;What is the reason for this?&#8221; It is because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised. Yet she was your partner, and the wife of your covenant.</content>

      <content> This last phrase could mean that the priests have accepted the law superficially, or that the priests have shown partiality in the law by accepting one person above another, or that the priests have taken their face (based their reputation and outward appearances) on the law, but without following it.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;sanctificationem&#8217; means holiness or sanctity, or something that is holy or sanctified. In the Catholic view, this may refer to the Sacraments, and particularly to the Sacrament of the Eucharist; it may also refer to those who are sanctified by the Sacraments.</content>

      <content> The first part of this verse could be interpreted to mean that, if you hold hatred for your wife, send her away (but then iniquity will be your garment). Or it could be interpreted to mean, if you hold hatred, send the hatred away, in which iniquity will not be your garment.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;angelum&#8217; could also be translated as &#8216;messenger.&#8217; The messenger is John the Baptist, who is like an angel in that he has never committed any personal sins. The word &#8216;Dominator&#8217; is not the same as the word &#8216;Dominus.&#8217; The former means &#8216;Sovereign&#8217; or &#8216;Master,&#8217; whereas the latter means &#8216;Lord.&#8217; The verb &#8216;veniet&#8217; is usually translated as &#8216;will come,&#8217; but this expression is overused in Bible translations. There are other possible accurate translations of this word, such as &#8216;will arrive&#8217; or &#8216;will approach&#8217; that may better fit a particular context. The &#8216;angelus testamenti&#8217; is John the Baptist, who gives testimony that Jesus is the true Christ.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;maleficis&#8217; is sometimes translated as sorcerers, but it literally means &#8216;evil-doers.&#8217; The word &#8216;calumniantur&#8217; usually refers to making false accusations, but in this context it refers to those who misrepresent the wages or moneys due to a worker, widow, or orphan.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;configimus&#8217; can mean &#8216;to affix with nails&#8217; or &#8216;to pierce through&#8217; with something. The meaning is close to that of crucifixion. Also, &#8216;configitis&#8217; is made more intense in meaning, by the prefix &#8216;con,&#8217; than &#8216;affliget.&#8217;</content>
