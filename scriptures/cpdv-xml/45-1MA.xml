      <content> Notice that the book begins as if it were a continuation of another book: &#8220;And it happened afterwards....&#8221; The author of this book must have written another book (apparently one not inspired as Scripture), on the topic of Jewish history. That book is not part of Scripture and this one is.</content>

      <content> Literally, they made themselves foreskins, in other words, they tried to undo their circumcision. This verse has a spiritual meaning, referring to those Christians who abandon the faith and act as if they were never baptized.</content>

    <note num="3">
      <content> Literally, &#8216;mensam propositionis&#8217; is &#8216;the table of showing,&#8217; i.e. the table for the bread of the Presence used in ancient times by the Jews. This bread of the Presence was a foreshadowing of the Eucharist, in which Christ is fully Present. Antiochus was a foreshadowing of the Antichrist, who will take away the Eucharist from most places on earth, and replace it with the abomination of desolation.</content>

      <content> A bridegroom is either one who is about to marry or one who has recently married. The expression, &#8216;those who sat in the marriage bed&#8217; refers to newlyweds.</content>

      <content> The land shook because of an earthquake; this verse predicts an earthquake about the time that the Antichrist invades and conquers the holy land of Israel (about 2430/2431).</content>

      <content> The expression &#8216;two years of days&#8217; means two full years, as opposed to the usual Jewish method of counting the years, which would count any length of time overlapping two calendar years as two years.</content>

      <content> Again, this is a foreshadowing of the Antichrist, who will try to unite all nations under his one government. All the unbelievers will comply, but the true believers in God will resist him.</content>

      <content> This prohibition against religion was a foreshadowing of the Antichrist&#8217;s reign.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="9">
      <content> This text refers, eschatologically, to the time during the Antichrist&#8217;s reign, when he tries to destroy the Church from within by promoting a perverse imitation of the sacrifice of the Mass and of the Eucharist. This perverse imitation of the Eucharist is called the abomination of desolation.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="10">
      <content> Here is a clear example where &#8216;filios&#8217; can only refer to male children, i.e. &#8216;sons.&#8217; The word clearly means &#8216;sons,&#8217; yet many translators insist on translating it inaccurately as &#8216;children.&#8217; Inclusive language pleases society and displeases God.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="11">
      <content> The abomination of desolation is mentioned here, in its foreshadowing during Old Testament times. Also mentioned is the badly altered version of the Christian faith that the Antichrist supports (beginning about halfway through his reign) in order to try to destroy the Church from within.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="12">
      <content> These leaders foreshadow the apostate and severely heretical Christians who will be appointed by the Antichrist to try to destroy the Church from within. It is these ones who devise and set up the abomination of desolation, the perverse imitation of the Eucharist with its false and perverse imitation of the Mass.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="13">
      <content> The word &#8216;trucidabant&#8217; refers to killing someone, or a group of people, in a particularly violent manner, i.e. to butcher or to slaughter.</content>

    <note num="14">
      <content> Some Christians will choose to die, rather than to consume the abomination of desolation, that false and perverse imitation of the Eucharist.</content>

      <content>In those days, there occurred a very great famine, and the entire region handed itself over to Bacchides.</content>

      <content>Now in the second month of the one hundred and fifty-third year, Alcimus instructed that the walls of the inner court of the sanctuary be destroyed, and that the works of the prophets be destroyed. And he began to destroy them.</content>

    </note>
    <note num="9">
      <content> Despite the advantage of having foiled the ambush, the men on Jonathan&#8217;s side fled during combat. The phrase &#8220;princeps militi&#230; exercitus&#8221; has the singular &#8216;princeps,&#8217; so it refers only to Judas, not also to Mattathias. The last two words each could be taken to refer to the army, but in that case the phrase would be redundant. The last word, &#8216;exercitus,&#8217; could also be a participle. In other words, Judas was the leader of military training, not the leader of the whole army. This makes more sense because, if Judas and Mattathias were the two leaders of the army, then everyone would not have fled. But if Mattathias were merely a soldier, and Judas was in charge of training soldiers, the others could have fled despite their example.</content>
