    <verse num="18">
      <content>Now the procreation of the Christ occurred in this way. After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they lived together, she was found to have conceived in her womb by the Holy Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Then Joseph, her husband, since he was just and was not willing to hand her over, preferred to send her away secretly.</content>

      <content>But while thinking over these things, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: &#8220;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to accept Mary as your wife. For what has been formed in her is of the Holy Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">

      <content>And he knew her not, yet she bore her son, the firstborn. And he called his name JESUS.</content>

    <note num="1">
      <content> Notice that after many uses of the formula &#8216;one man conceived another man,&#8217; the passage does not say that Joseph conceived (genuit) Jesus. The break in this formula indicates the understanding of Matthew and of the Church from its earliest days, that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content> The expression &#8216;in utero habebit&#8217; literally means &#8216;shall have in the womb.&#8217; But this verse is a quote from Isaiah 7:14, which, in the Latin, uses &#8216;virgo concipiet&#8217; rather than &#8216;in utero habebit.&#8217; Therefore, the use of the translation &#8216;shall conceive in her womb&#8217; to convey the expression &#8216;shall have in the womb&#8217; is justified. Verse 18 which has a similar expression, with a similar translation.</content>

      <content>And so, when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judah, in the days of king Herod, behold, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,</content>

      <content>And having received a response in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back by another way to their own region.</content>

      <content>And after they had gone away, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: &#8220;Rise up, and take the boy and his mother, and flee into Egypt. And remain there until I tell you. For it will happen that Herod will seek the boy to destroy him.&#8221;</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;cedebat&#8217; sometimes has the meaning of falling, or descending. The star did not merely continue to lead them forward, but it also descended as it led them through Bethlehem. Otherwise, they could not have known from a star (or comet) which location within Bethlehem was correct.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> Notice that the words &#8216;ploratus, plorans&#8217; are translated differently, as &#8216;weeping, crying.&#8217; It sometimes happens that the same word used twice is translated by two different words in English, or that two different words in Latin are translated by the same word in English. To translated the same word in Latin by always the same word in English would result in a translation that was, at best, stilted, and, at worst, inaccurate or incorrect.</content>

    <note num="4">
      <content> The word &#8216;me&#8217; is used instead of the grammatically correct &#8216;than I&#8217; because it sounds more natural in English and because it makes a better parallel with the phrase &#8216;after me&#8217;. Even though the verse literally says &#8216;and fire,&#8217; the word &#8216;et&#8217; is sometimes used in Latin in a way that it is not used in English, to combine two qualities of the same thing. So the Baptism of Christ is not Holy Spirit and also fire, but rather the figurative fire of the Holy Spirit.</content>

      <content> If a man is accused of murder, he is liable to judgment, in order to determine if he is guilty of murder or if the deceased was guilty (as in cases of self-defense). Similarly, if a man is angry with his brother, he is liable to judgment to determine if he is sinning by his anger, or if his brother is guilty (as in cases of righteous anger). The same applies to the other two cases. Calling someone a name (or, to the same effect, accusing someone of something) makes one liable to judgment. As it is said in the secular courts, the truth is an effective defense against accusations of slander. So the judgment is to determine if the accusation is true, in which case the judgment would be not guilty.</content>

A translation such as &#8216;take heart&#8217; or &#8216;have confidence&#8217; would not be as accurate a translation of the Latin, because the context is that Jesus was responding to their faith.

Also, Christ was taken prisoner on Thursday evening, and then confined in a subterranean prison overnight (first night in the heart of the earth). He died on Friday about the ninth hour, and was buried in a tomb before sunset (the first day). He then remained dead to the world for Friday night (the second night) and Saturday daytime (the second day) as well as Saturday night (the third night). He arose early on Sunday after first light (the third day). Therefore, His statement that He would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth is true.</content>

The morning is symbolic of a time of true light on earth, especially when Christ, the morning star, returns; yet they say about the morning that it brings trouble.</content>

      <content> The translation here prefers &#8216;chaste persons&#8217; over eunuchs or celibate persons for a number of reasons. First, the term eunuch is used figuratively by Christ, as is the term &#8216;castraverunt&#8217; (castrated). Second, the term eunuch is obscure today. Third, this passage began with a teaching on the proper behavior of married persons, so it is not solely about virgins or celibate clergy and religious. The term &#8216;chaste persons&#8217; has sufficient breadth and depth, and is an accurate representation of the meaning of the term.</content>

      <content> It is often said, by the foolish, that the camel in this saying is literally a camel, and that the 'eye of a needle' is a particular gate into the city of Jerusalem. They claim that Jesus was only referring to getting a camel through that small gateway, when he expressed how hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God. But even though that gateway is narrow, it is not too difficult to get a camel through it. Perhaps it happened on a near daily basis. If this was the meaning of the saying, then it would not seem too difficult for the wealthy to enter heaven, and the disciples would be foolish to say 'Then who will be able to be saved?' And again, if so, then Jesus would not have said that it was impossible for men. So the saying has another meaning. It is a literal expression of the miraculous power of God. For a wealthy person to be saved, apart from the infinite mercy of God is impossible, nearly as impossible as literally passing a camel through the eye of a needle. But both acts can be done by the power of God.</content>

      <content> In my theological opinion, Judas truly repented from his betrayal of Christ. Therefore, the salvation of those who go to Heaven is not dependent on Judas having been sent to Hell. Yet Judas next despaired of the Mercy of God, killing himself. Therefore, he went to Hell for the latter sin, not for the former sin.</content>

      <content> The text in Latin does not say any word referring to a dream. The word &#8216;visum&#8217; means vision. Also, she says &#8216;today,&#8217; not &#8216;in the night,&#8217; and there is no reference to sleep. Compare this to other references in Scripture about dreams versus visions. It is clear that this was a vision, not a dream.</content>

      <content> The two Marys set out at first light, but before the sun rose over the horizon. This period of time is similar to the time after sunset, when it is not yet dark. The length of this time is approximately an hour. Although the word &#8216;evening&#8217; is used very broadly today, it specifically refers to that period of time between sunset and darkness, or, as in this case, between darkness and sunrise. So the two Marys set out at evening, that is, at first light in the morning, but before sunrise. The translation avoids this confusion of terms by using morning, instead of evening.</content>
