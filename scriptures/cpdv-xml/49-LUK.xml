    <verse num="1">
      <content>Since, indeed, many have attempted to set in order a narrative of the things that have been completed among us,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>just as they have been handed on to those of us who from the beginning saw the same and were ministers of the word,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>so it seemed good to me also, having diligently followed everything from the beginning, to write to you, in an orderly manner, most excellent Theophilus,</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>so that you might know the truthfulness of those words by which you have been instructed.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>There was, in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the section of Abijah, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now they were both just before God, progressing in all of the commandments and the justifications of the Lord without blame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both had become advanced in years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then it happened that, when he was exercising the priesthood before God, in the order of his section,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>according to the custom of the priesthood, the lot fell so that he would offer incense, entering into the temple of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And the entire multitude of the people was praying outside, at the hour of incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then there appeared to him an Angel of the Lord, standing at the right of the altar of incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And upon seeing him, Zechariah was disturbed, and fear fell over him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But the Angel said to him: &#8220;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you. And you shall call his name John.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And there will be joy and exultation for you, and many will rejoice in his nativity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&#8217;s womb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And he will convert many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he will go before him with the spirit and power of Elijah, so that he may turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons, and the incredulous to the prudence of the just, so as to prepare for the Lord a completed people.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And Zechariah said to the Angel: &#8220;How may I know this? For I am elderly, and my wife is advanced in years.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And in response, the Angel said to him: &#8220;I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I have been sent to speak to you, and to proclaim these things to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak, until the day on which these things shall be, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And the people were waiting for Zechariah. And they wondered why he was being delayed in the temple.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Then, when he came out, he was unable to speak to them. And they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, but he remained mute.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And it happened that, after the days of his office were completed, he went away to his house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Then, after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she hid herself for five months, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>&#8220;For the Lord did this for me, at the time when he decided to take away my reproach among men.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Then, in the sixth month, the Angel Gabriel was sent by God, to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And upon entering, the Angel said to her: &#8220;Hail, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And when she had heard this, she was disturbed by his words, and she considered what kind of greeting this might be.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And the Angel said to her: &#8220;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and you shall bear a son, and you shall call his name: JESUS.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>He will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father. And he will reign in the house of Jacob for eternity.</content>

    <verse num="33">
      <content>And his kingdom shall have no end.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Then Mary said to the Angel, &#8220;How shall this be done, since I do not know man?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And in response, the Angel said to her: &#8220;The Holy Spirit will pass over you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. And because of this also, the Holy One who will be born of you shall be called the Son of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And behold, your cousin Elizabeth has herself also conceived a son, in her old age. And this is the sixth month for her who is called barren.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And it happened that, as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</content>

      <content> In this context, &#8216;confess to the Lord&#8217; means that she gave thanks to the Lord; it also has the connotation of acknowledging the works and blessings of the Lord.</content>

      <content> This verse is translated more literally than most translations; I think that, in this case, the more literal translation is at once both more obscure, but more profound.</content>

      <content>Then, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being procurator of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>under the high priests Annas and Caiaphas: the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And he went into the entire region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>just as it has been written in the book of the sermons of the prophet Isaiah: &#8220;The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight his paths.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low. And what is crooked shall be made straight. And the rough paths shall be made into level ways.</content>

      <content>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Therefore, he said to the crowd that went out in order to be baptized by him: &#8220;You progeny of vipers! Who told you to flee from the approaching wrath?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>So then, produce fruits worthy of repentance. And do not begin to say, &#8216;We have Abraham as our father.&#8217; For I tell you that God has the power to raise up sons to Abraham from these stones.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For even now the axe has been placed at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.&#8221;</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now the tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, &#8220;Teacher, what should we do?&#8221;</content>

      <content>Then the soldiers also questioned him, saying, &#8220;And what should we do?&#8221; And he said to them: &#8220;You should strike no one, and you should not make false accusations. And be content with your pay.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Now all were thinking about John in their hearts, and the people were supposing that perhaps he might be the Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>John responded by saying to everyone: &#8220;Indeed, I baptize you with water. But there will arrive one stronger than me, the laces of whose shoes I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit, and with fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>His winnowing fan is in his hand. And he will purify his threshing floor. And he will gather the wheat into the barn. But the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&#8221;</content>

      <content> The second first Sabbath is the first Sabbath after the first Sabbath of Passover. The first Sabbath of Passover is used as a starting point for counting the seven weeks (and seven Sabbaths) until the Feast of Weeks. The day after the first Sabbath of Passover is day one in that count. (The ancients did not use the concept of zero in counting, but in our way of thinking, the first Sabbath of Passover is zero.) So the first week of the seven weeks ends with the first Sabbath of the seven Sabbaths on day 7. This is the first Sabbath in the count of seven Sabbaths to the Feast of Weeks (which is held on the day after that 7th Sabbath, i.e. the fiftieth day, or Pentecost). So there are two first Sabbaths: the first Sabbath during Passover (the day used to mark the start of the counting toward the Feast of Weeks, which is also called Pentecost) and the first Sabbath after Passover, which is the second first Sabbath.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> This interpretation is proved correct by the interaction between the Pharisees, the disciples, and Jesus. It was against the Law to eat from the standing ripe grain on the first Sabbath during Passover, because not until the next day were the first fruits of the ripe grain offered to God. But on the second first Sabbath it was lawful to eat from the standing ripe grain, because the first fruits had been offered the previous Sunday. The Pharisees object based on an over-extension of the Law against working on the Sabbath, but Luke points out that they had no ground to stand on under the Law since it was the second first Sabbath.</content>

      <content> The story of the return of the Prodigal son is a prophecy in Scripture of the return of the Protestant Churches to unity with the Catholic Church. This return begins during a great famine; the famine ends only when the Protestant Churches unite with the Catholic Church. This verse, and the symbol of the &#8216;first robe&#8217; indicates that the formerly-Protestant branches of the Catholic Church will have one of their members chosen as a true Pope of the Catholic Church. The symbol of the ring indicates that they will have members chosen as Bishops, and the symbol of the shoes indicates that they will have members chosen as priests and missionaries. This Pope, who will not be Roman Catholic, but will be from one of the new branches of the Catholic Church (from one of the formerly Protestant Churches), will be elected about the year 2022.</content>

      <content> In my speculative eschatology, this interaction between the elder son and the father is a prophecy in Scripture of a future Ecumenical Council, which will decide the questions of whether the Protestant Churches should have been united with the Catholic Church, and of how they should be united. The Council will decide that the unification of the Protestant Churches with the Catholic Church was necessary and just and pleasing to God.</content>

      <content> This last part is not saying that God is patient. It is a common error among translators to interpret an obscure verse as having a meaning that is uninformative and excessively simplified, rather than to clarify the true meaning of the verse, or to leave it obscure. We already know that God is patient. The point of the parable is not that God is patient, but rather that, if you pester God enough for something, He will  give it to you, rather than continue to endure your complaints.</content>

      <content>And the entire multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Then they began to accuse him, saying, &#8220;We found this one subverting our nation, and prohibiting giving tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>And Pilate questioned him, saying: &#8220;You are the king of the Jews?&#8221; But in response, he said: &#8220;You are saying it.&#8221;</content>

      <content>But they continued more intensely, saying: &#8220;He has stirred up the people, teaching throughout all of Judea, beginning from Galilee, even to this place.&#8221;</content>

      <content>Then Herod, upon seeing Jesus, was very glad. For he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard so many things about him, and he was hoping to see some kind of sign wrought by him.</content>

      <content> We know from the Gospel of Mark that the centurion was not merely saying that Jesus was a good man or a just man, but the Son of God. Some might argue that the centurion lacked true faith, and was merely remarking on Jesus&#8217; innocence, that he was just, but not the Son of God. But the Romans believed in gods and sons of gods, so the centurion had a basic understanding that God can have a Son. And a Roman soldier stationed in Judea would certainly be aware of the controversies among the inhabitants. So he knew that many believed in Jesus as the Son of God, and he also knew that this was the controversy over which he was killed. Then, knowing all this, upon seeing the very act of Christ dying for our salvation, which effects the salvation of all, his comment was not merely that Jesus was innocent. For Christ was only innocent of the charges, if He is the Son of God and the Just One. If Jesus were merely a just man, or a son of God as all men are sons of God, then He would not be innocent. Therefore, the Soldier was saying that this man Jesus was truly the Son of God, the Just One.</content>

      <content>He is not here, for he has risen. Recall how he spoke to you, when he was still in Galilee,</content>

      <content>And behold, two of them went out, on the same day, to a town named Emmaus, which was the distance of sixty stadia from Jerusalem.</content>

      <content>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, responded by saying to him, &#8220;Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And he said to them, &#8220;What things?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;About Jesus of Nazareth, who was a noble prophet, powerful in works and in words, before God and all the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death. And they crucified him.</content>

      <content>Then, too, certain women from among us terrified us. For before daytime, they were at the tomb,</content>

      <content>Was not the Christ required to suffer these things, and so enter into his glory?&#8221;</content>
