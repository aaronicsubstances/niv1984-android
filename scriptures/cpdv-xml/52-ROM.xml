      <content>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called as an Apostle, separated for the Gospel of God,</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>which he had promised beforehand, through his Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures,</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>about his Son, who was made for him from the offspring of David according to the flesh,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>the Son of God, who was predestined in virtue according to the Spirit of sanctification from the resurrection of the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>through whom we have received grace and Apostleship, for the sake of his name, for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>from whom you also have been called by Jesus Christ:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>To all who are at Rome, the beloved of God, called as saints. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Certainly, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, first for all of you, because your faith is being announced throughout the entire world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit by the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I have kept a remembrance of you</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>always in my prayers, pleading that in some way, at some time, I may have a prosperous journey, within the will of God, to come to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you a certain spiritual grace to strengthen you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>specifically, to be consoled together with you through that which is mutual: your faith and mine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, (though I have been hindered even to the present time) so that I might obtain some fruit among you also, just as also among the other Gentiles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>To the Greeks and to the uncivilized, to the wise and to the foolish, I am in debt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So within me there is a prompting to evangelize to you also who are at Rome.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation for all believers, the Jew first, and the Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For the justice of God is revealed within it, by faith unto faith, just as it was written: &#8220;For the just one lives by faith.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven over every impiety and injustice among those men who fend off the truth of God with injustice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For what is known about God is manifest in them. For God has manifested it to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For unseen things about him have been made conspicuous, since the creation of the world, being understood by the things that were made; likewise his everlasting virtue and divinity, so much so that they have no excuse.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For although they had known God, they did not glorify God, nor give thanks. Instead, they became weakened in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was obscured.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For, while proclaiming themselves to be wise, they became foolish.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of four-legged beasts, and of serpents.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For this reason, God handed them over to the desires of their own heart for impurity, so that they afflicted their own bodies with indignities among themselves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And they exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And they worshipped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is blessed for all eternity. Amen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Because of this, God handed them over to shameful passions. For example, their females have exchanged the natural use of the body for a use which is against nature.</content>

    <verse num="27">
      <content>And similarly, the males also, abandoning the natural use of females, have burned in their desires for one another: males doing with males what is disgraceful, and receiving within themselves the recompense that necessarily results from their error.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And since they did not prove to have God by knowledge, God handed them over to a morally depraved way of thinking, so that they might do those things which are not fitting:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>having been completely filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, spite, gossiping;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>slanderous, hateful toward God, abusive, arrogant, self-exalting, devisers of evil, disobedient to parents,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>foolish, disorderly; without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And these, though they had known the justice of God, did not understand that those who act in such a manner are deserving of death, and not only those who do these things, but also those who consent to what is done.</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The term &#8216;naturalem usum&#8217; is a way of referring discreetly to natural sexual relations. The word &#8216;naturalem&#8217; refers to what is natural, but it is also used to refer to the body, or even specifically to the genitals. The earlier reference to &#8216;shameful passions&#8217; provides a context indicating that &#8216;naturalem&#8217; does not merely refer to what is natural in general, but specifically to the natural use of the genitals, that is, to natural sexual intercourse.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>For this reason, O man, each one of you who judges is inexcusable. For by that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For we know that the judgment of God is in accord with truth against those who do such things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But, O man, when you judge those who do such things as you yourself also do, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?</content>

      <content>But in accord with your hard and impenitent heart, you store up wrath for yourself, unto the day of wrath and of revelation by the just judgment of God.</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>For he will render to each one according to his works:</content>

      <content>To those who, in accord with patient good works, seek glory and honor and incorruption, certainly, he will render eternal life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But to those who are contentious and who do not acquiesce to the truth, but instead trust in iniquity, he will render wrath and indignation.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that works evil: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But glory and honor and peace are for all who do what is good: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>For there is no favoritism with God.</content>

    </verse>

      <content>Certainly, circumcision is beneficial, if you observe the law. But if you are a betrayer of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>But if even our injustice points to the justice of God, what shall we say? Could God be unfair for inflicting wrath?</content>

      <content>What is next? Should we try to excel ahead of them? By no means! For we have accused all Jews and Greeks to be under sin,</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>So then, what shall we say that Abraham had achieved, who is our father according to the flesh?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if Abraham was justified by works, he would have glory, but not with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For what does Scripture say? &#8220;Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But for he who works, wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to debt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Yet truly, for he who does not work, but who believes in him who justifies the impious, his faith is reputed unto justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Similarly, David also declares the blessedness of a man, to whom God brings justice without works:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>&#8220;Blessed are they whose iniquities have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But then how was it reputed? In circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For he received the sign of circumcision as a symbol of the justice of that faith which exists apart from circumcision, so that he might be the father of all those who believe while uncircumcised, so that it might also be reputed to them unto justice,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>and he might be the father of circumcision, not only for those who are of circumcision, but even for those who follow the footsteps of that faith which is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For the Promise to Abraham, and to his posterity, that he would inherit the world, was not through the law, but through the justice of faith.</content>

      <content>For if those who are of the law are the heirs, then faith becomes empty and the Promise is abolished.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>in whom he believed, who revives the dead and who calls those things that do not exist into existence. For it is written: &#8220;I have established you as the father of many nations.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>And he believed, with a hope beyond hope, so that he might become the father of many nations, according to what was said to him: &#8220;So shall your posterity be.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And he was not weakened in faith, nor did he consider his own body to be dead (though he was then almost one hundred years old), nor the womb of Sarah to be dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And then, in the Promise of God, he did not hesitate out of distrust, but instead he was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>For example, a woman who is subject to a husband is obligated by the law while her husband lives. But when her husband has died, she is released from the law of her husband.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Therefore, while her husband lives, if she has been with another man, she should be called an adulteress. But when her husband has died, she is freed from the law of her husband, such that, if she has been with another man, she is not an adulteress.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And so, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law, through the body of Christ, so that you may be another one who has risen from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.</content>

      <content>What should we say next? Is the law sin? Let it not be so! But I do not know sin, except through the law. For example, I would not have known about coveting, unless the law said: &#8220;You shall not covet.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>

      <content>For if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are not now walking according to love. Do not allow your food to destroy him for whom Christ died.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Therefore, what is good for us should not be a cause of blasphemy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but rather justice and peace and joy, in the Holy Spirit.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>For he who serves Christ in this, pleases God and is proven before men.</content>

      <content>And so, let us pursue the things that are of peace, and let us keep to the things that are for the edification of one another.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>Do not be willing to destroy the work of God because of food. Certainly, all things are clean. But there is harm for a man who offends by eating.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>It is good to refrain from eating meat and from drinking wine, and from anything by which your brother is offended, or led astray, or weakened.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Do you have faith? It belongs to you, so hold it before God. Blessed is he who does not judge himself in that by which he is tested.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But he who discerns, if he eats, is condemned, because it is not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</content>

    <note num="1">
      <content> The one who eats discerns that, in this present age (New Testament times), eating formerly-unclean foods is permitted, even though it was not permitted in the previous age (Old Testament times). The one who discerns unto every age refrains from eating, for self-denial and self-restraint is permitted in every age.</content>

      <content>But we who are stronger must bear with the feebleness of the weak, and not so as to please ourselves.</content>

      <content>Each one of you should please his neighbor unto good, for edification.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For even Christ did not please himself, but as it was written: &#8220;The reproaches of those who reproached you fell upon me.&#8221;</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>For whatever was written, was written to teach us, so that, through patience and the consolation of the Scriptures, we might have hope.</content>

      <content>So may the God of patience and solace grant you to be of one mind toward one another, in accord with Jesus Christ,</content>

      <content>so that, together with one mouth, you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

      <content>For this reason, accept one another, just as Christ also has accepted you, in the honor of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For I declare that Christ Jesus was the minister of circumcision because of the truth of God, so as to confirm the promises to the fathers,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and that the Gentiles are to honor God because of his mercy, just as it was written: &#8220;Because of this, I will confess you among the Gentiles, O Lord, and I will sing to your name.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And again, he says: &#8220;Rejoice, O Gentiles, along with his people.&#8221;</content>

      <content>so that I may be a minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles, sanctifying the Gospel of God, in order that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and may be sanctified in the Holy Spirit.</content>

      <content>Therefore, I have glory in Christ Jesus before God.</content>

      <content>And so I have preached this Gospel, not where Christ was known by name, lest I build upon the foundation of another,</content>

      <content>But next I will set out for Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.</content>

      <content>Therefore, when I have completed this task, and have consigned to them this fruit, I shall set out, by way of you, to Spain.</content>
