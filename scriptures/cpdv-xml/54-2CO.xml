      <content>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all of Achaia:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>He consoles us in all our tribulation, so that we too may be able to console those who are in any kind of distress, through the exhortation by which we also are being exhorted by God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For just as the Passion of Christ abounds in us, so also, through Christ, does our consolation abound.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>So, if we are in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation, or if we are in consolation, it is for your consolation, or if we are exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which results in the patient endurance of the same passion which we also endure.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So may our hope for you be made firm, knowing that, just as you are participants in the suffering, so also shall you be participants in the consolation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our tribulation, which happened to us in Asia. For we were weighed down beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we became weary, even of life itself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But we had within ourselves the response to death, so that we would not have faith in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>He has rescued us, and he is rescuing us, from great peril. In him, we hope that he will continue to rescue us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And you are assisting, with your prayers for us, so that from many persons, by that which is a gift in us, thanks may be given through many persons, because of us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For our glory is this: the testimony of our conscience, which is found in simplicity of heart and in sincerity toward God. And it is not with worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God, that we have conversed with this world, and more abundantly toward you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For we write nothing else to you other than what you have read and understood. And I hope that you will continue to understand, even unto the end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And just as you have acknowledged us in our role, that we are your glory, so also you are ours, unto the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then, although I had intended this, did I act lightly? Or in the things that I consider, do I consider according to the flesh, so that there would be, with me, both Yes and No?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But God is faithful, so our word, which was set before you, was not, in him, both Yes and No.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through myself and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not Yes, and No; but was simply Yes in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For whatever promises are of God are, in him, Yes. For this reason, too, through him: Amen to God for our glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now the One who confirms us with you in Christ, and who has anointed us, is God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And he has sealed us, and he has placed the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But I call God as a witness to my soul, that I was lenient with you, in that I did not return to Corinth:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>not because we have dominion over your faith, but because we are assistants of your joy. For by faith you stand.</content>

    <note num="1">
      <content> The verb &#8216;cognovistis&#8217; in this context has more of the meaning &#8216;to acknowledge&#8217; or &#8216;to recognize,&#8217; rather than to know a fact or a person. The phrase &#8216;ex parte,&#8217; which occurs several times in this passage, is somewhat idiomatic, indicating someone&#8217;s role, as in the expressions &#8216;for my part&#8217; or &#8216;in my role.&#8217;</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And so, I wrote this same thing to you, so that I might not, when I arrive, add sorrow to sorrow for those with whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you in all things, so that my joy may be entirely yours.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For with much tribulation and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not so that you would be sorrowful, but so that you might know the charity that I have more abundantly toward you.</content>

      <content>But anyone whom you have forgiven of anything, I also forgive. And then, too, anyone I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it was done in the person of Christ for your sakes,</content>

      <content>To the one, certainly, the fragrance is of death unto death. But to the other, the fragrance is of life unto life. And concerning these things, who is so suitable?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For we are not like many others, adulterating the Word of God. But instead, we speak with sincerity: from God, before God, and in Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The Latin verb &#8216;contristavit&#8217; is intransitive in the first part of the verse, but this makes the English phrasing somewhat awkward, &#8216;If anyone has sorrowed [no object], he has not sorrowed me.&#8217; So the phrasing &#8216;has brought sorrow&#8217; is used.</content>

      <content>You are our Epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men.</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>It has been made manifest that you are the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written down, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, and not on tablets of stone, but on the fleshly tablets of the heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And we have such faith, through Christ, toward God.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>It is not that we are adequate to think anything of ourselves, as if anything was from us. But our adequacy is from God.</content>

      <content>And he has made us suitable ministers of the New Testament, not in the letter, but in the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But if the ministration of death, engraved with letters upon stones, was in glory, (so much so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze intently upon the face of Moses, because of the glory of his countenance) even though this ministration was ineffective,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>how could the ministration of the Spirit not be in greater glory?</content>

      <content>and not as Moses did, in placing a veil over his face, so that the sons of Israel would not gaze intently at his face. This was ineffective,</content>
    </verse>

      <content>for their minds were obtuse. And, even until this present day, the very same veil, in the readings from the Old Testament, remains not taken away (though, in Christ, it is taken away).</content>

    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The meaning of the Old Testament is veiled in that many Jews did not recognize that it refers to Jesus as the Messiah. It remains veiled to the Jews (even in the present time), but in Christ the hidden truths of the Old Testament are revealed and the veil is taken away.</content>

      <content>I asked for Titus, and I sent a brother with him. Did Titus defraud you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</content>

      <content>Yet I fear, lest perhaps, when I have arrived, I might not find you such as I would want, and I might be found by you, such as you would not want. For perhaps there may be among you: contention, envy, animosity, dissension, detraction, whispering, self-exaltation, and rebellion.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>If so, then, when I have arrived, God may again humble me among you. And so, I mourn for the many who sinned beforehand, and did not repent, over the lust and fornication and homosexuality, which they have committed.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;virtus&#8217; can mean power or it can mean virtue; in the Christian context, and in any context referring to God, it really means both. In God, virtue and power are the same; in Christians, our power is in our virtue, and not in worldly power.</content>

      <content> This last part, &#8216;forgive me this injury,&#8217; is said sarcastically.</content>

      <content> The word immunditia refers to uncleanness, but in this context it is not the ritual uncleanness of the Old Testament, but an uncleanness of heart with respect to sexuality, in other words, lust. The word impudicitia can refer to serious sexual immorality in general, but it often is used to refer to homosexuality. Since the other words in this list refer more generally to sexual immorality, this word must refer to the more specific sin of homosexuality (otherwise the word would be redundant and unnecessary to the sentence). Notice the progression in this list of offenses: first inner sexual sins, then fornication, then a more serious type of fornication, homosexuality.</content>
