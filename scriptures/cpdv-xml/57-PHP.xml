      <content>Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>I give thanks to my God, with every remembrance of you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>always, in all my prayers, making supplication for all of you with joy,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>because of your communion in the Gospel of Christ, from the first day even until now.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>I am confident of this very thing: that he who has begun this good work in you will perfect it, unto the day of Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So then, it is right for me to feel this way about all of you, because I hold you in my heart, and because, in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For God is my witness how, within the heart of Jesus Christ, I long for all of you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And this I pray: that your charity may abound more and more, with knowledge and with all understanding,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>so that you may be confirmed in what is better, in order that you may be sincere and without offense on the day of Christ:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, in the glory and praise of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now, brothers, I want you to know that the things concerning me happened for the advancement of the Gospel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>in such a way that my chains have become manifest in Christ in every place of judgment and in all other such places.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And many from among the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident through my chains, are now much bolder in speaking the Word of God without fear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Certainly, some do so even because of envy and contention; and others, too, do so because of a good will to preach Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Some act out of charity, knowing that I have been appointed for the defense of the Gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But others, out of contention, announce Christ insincerely, claiming that their difficulties lift them up to my chains.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But what does it matter? As long as, by every means, whether under pretext or in truthfulness, Christ is announced. And about this, I rejoice, and moreover, I will continue to rejoice.</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>For I know that this will bring me to salvation, through your prayers and under the ministration of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>by means of my own expectation and hope. For in nothing shall I be confounded. Instead, with all confidence, now just as always, Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And while I live in the flesh, for me, there is the fruit of works. But I do not know which I would choose.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For I am constrained between the two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is the far better thing,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>but then to remain in the flesh is necessary for your sake.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and that I shall continue to remain with all of you, for your advancement and for your joy in the faith,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>so that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, through my return to you again.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Only let your behavior be worthy of the Gospel of Christ, so that, whether I return and see you, or whether, being absent, I hear about you, still you may stand firm with one spirit, with one mind, laboring together for the faith of the Gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And in nothing be terrified by the adversaries. For what is to them an occasion of perdition, is to you an occasion of salvation, and this is from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>For this has been given to you on behalf of Christ, not only so that you may believe in him, but even so that you may suffer with him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>engaging in the same struggle, of a kind which you also have seen in me, and which you now have heard from me.</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The word &#8216;occasionem,&#8217; in this context, refers to acting under a pretext; it does not refer to an occasion or an opportunity. Thus, &#8216;veritatem&#8217; is not so much &#8216;the truth&#8217; as preaching or announcing Christ with truthfulness, that is, out of sincere motives.</content>

      <content>Let nothing be done by contention, nor in vain glory. Instead, in humility, let each of you esteem others to be better than himself.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>For this understanding in you was also in Christ Jesus:</content>

      <content>And so, my most beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but even more so now in my absence: work toward your salvation with fear and trembling.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For it is God who works in you, both so as to choose, and so as to act, in accord with his good will.</content>

      <content>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, in order that I may be encouraged, when I know the things concerning you.</content>

      <content>Now I have considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and co-worker, and fellow soldier, and an attendant to my needs, but your Apostle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For certainly, he has desired all of you, and he was saddened because you had heard that he was sick.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For he was sick, even unto death, but God took pity on him, and not only on him, but truly on myself also, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Therefore, I sent him more readily, in order that, by seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And so, receive him with every joy in the Lord, and treat all those like him with honor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>For he was brought close even to death, for the sake of the work of Christ, handing over his own life, so that he might fulfill what was lacking from you concerning my service.</content>

      <content> On the spiritual level of meaning, this verse refers to the Great Schism between the West and much of the East. The Church in the West is the Latin Rite, and Euodia is a Latin name. But Syntyche is a Greek name. So Euodia is a figure for the West, and Syntyche is a figure for those Eastern Churches that went astray from the Faith. The Holy Spirit is using the historical disagreement between these two women (the Church is often represented under the figure of a Bride) to represent the Great Schism. And notice that the Spirit 'asks' Euodia (the West) but 'begs' Syntyche (the Eastern schismatice) indicating that it is the Eastern schismatics who have erred. This verse is the Holy Spirit asking for the healing of the Great Schism.</content>
