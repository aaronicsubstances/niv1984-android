      <content>For we know, brothers, beloved of God, of your election.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For our Gospel has not been among you in word alone, but also in virtue, and in the Holy Spirit, and with a great fullness, in the same manner as you know we have acted among you for your sake.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And so, you became imitators of us and of the Lord, accepting the Word in the midst of great tribulation, but with the joy of the Holy Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So have you become a pattern for all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For from you, the Word of the Lord was spread, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith, which is toward God, has advanced so much so that we do not need to speak to you about anything.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For others are reporting among us of the kind of acceptance we had among you, and how you were converted from idols to God, to the service of the living and true God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>and to the expectation of his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead), Jesus, who has rescued us from the approaching wrath.</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The word &#8216;laboris&#8217; is often best translated as &#8216;hardship&#8217; or &#8216;difficulties,&#8217; as in the sufferings that accompany living according to Christ, rather than translating it as &#8216;labor,&#8217; which seems in English to refer to work or employment in general.</content>

  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="1 Thessalonians 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For you yourselves know, brothers, that our acceptance among you was not empty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Instead, having previously suffered and been treated shamefully, as you know, at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, so as to speak the Gospel of God to you with much solicitude.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For our exhortation was not in error, nor from impurity, nor with deception.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But, just as we have been tested by God, so that the Gospel would be entrusted to us, so also did we speak, not so as to please men, but rather to please God, who tests our hearts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And neither did we, at any time, become flattering in speech, as you know, nor did we seek an opportunity for avarice, as God is witness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Nor did we seek the glory of men, neither from you, nor from others.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And although we could have been a burden to you, as Apostles of Christ, instead we became like little ones in your midst, like a nurse cherishing her children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>So desirous were we for you that we were willing to hand over to you, not only the Gospel of God, but even our own souls. For you have become most beloved to us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For you remember, brothers, our hardship and weariness. We preached the Gospel of God among you, working night and day, so that we would not be burdensome to any of you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>You are witnesses, as is God, of how holy and just and blameless we were with you who have believed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And you know the manner, with each one of you, like a father with his sons,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>in which we were pleading with you and consoling you, bearing witness, so that you would walk in a manner worthy of God, who has called you into his kingdom and glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For this reason also, we give thanks to God without ceasing: because, when you had accepted from us the Word of the hearing of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but (as it truly is) as the Word of God, who is working in you who have believed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For you, brothers, have become imitators of the churches of God which are at Judea, in Christ Jesus. For you, too, have suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen as they have suffered from the Jews,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>who also killed both the Lord Jesus, and the Prophets, and who have persecuted us. But they do not please God, and so they are adversaries to all men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>They prohibit us to speak to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved, and thus do they continually add to their own sins. But the wrath of God will overtake them in the very end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And we, brothers, having been deprived of you for a short time, in sight, but not in heart, have hurried all the more to see your face, with a great desire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For we wanted to come to you, (indeed, I, Paul, attempted to do so once, and then again,) but Satan impeded us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For what is our hope, and our joy, and our crown of glory? Is it not you, before our Lord Jesus Christ at his return?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For you are our glory and our joy.</content>

      <content>Because of this, willing to wait no longer, it was pleasing to us to remain at Athens, alone.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And we sent Timothy, our brother and a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and to exhort you, on behalf of your faith,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>so that no one would be disturbed during these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we have been appointed to this.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For even while we were with you, we predicted to you that we would suffer tribulations, even as it has happened, and as you know.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For this reason also, I was not willing to wait any longer, and I sent to find out about your faith, lest perhaps he who tempts may have tempted you, and our labor might have been in vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But then, when Timothy arrived to us from you, he reported to us your faith and charity, and that you keep a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us, just as we likewise desire to see you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>As a result, we were consoled in you, brothers, in the midst of all our difficulties and tribulations, through your faith.</content>

      <content>Therefore, concerning other things, brothers, we ask and beg you, in the Lord Jesus, that, just as you have received from us the way in which you ought to walk and to please God, so also may you walk, in order that you may abound all the more.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For you know what precepts I have given to you through the Lord Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from fornication,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>that each one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,</content>
    </verse>

      <content>not in passions of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God,</content>
    </verse>

      <content>and that no one should overwhelm or circumvent his brother in business. For the Lord is the vindicator of all these things, just as we have preached and testified to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For God has not called us to impurity, but to sanctification.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And so, whoever despises these teachings, does not despise man, but God, who has even provided his Holy Spirit within us.</content>

      <content>to choose work that allows you to be tranquil, and to carry out your business and to do your work with your own hands, just as we have instructed you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>and to walk honestly with those who are outside, and to desire nothing belonging to another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are sleeping, so as not to be sorrowful, like these others who do not have hope.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For if we believe that Jesus has died and risen again, so also will God bring back with Jesus those who sleep in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For we say this to you, in the Word of the Lord: that we who are alive, who remain until the return of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For the Lord himself, with a command and with the voice of an Archangel and with a trumpet of God, shall descend from heaven. And the dead, who are in Christ, shall rise up first.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Next, we who are alive, who are remaining, shall be taken up quickly together with them into the clouds to meet Christ in the air. And in this way, we shall be with the Lord always.</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;momentis&#8217; means movement, but often refers to time because the (apparent) movement of the sun, moon, and stars is used to track time. The word can also refer to important dates or events which change, alter, or &#8216;move&#8217; the course of human events.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="2">
      <content> Those who will proclaim &#8216;peace and security&#8217; are not the faithful, but those outside of the faith. In other words, when sinful secular society proclaims that they finally have peace and security, because all true religion (which ever accused them of their sins) seems to them to have been defeated, then the sufferings of the second part of the tribulation will overwhelm them. (Something similar, but lesser, happens during the first part of the tribulation (not long from now); when the Warning occurs, many false prophets and foolish persons will claim that the time of peace has begun, but instead the first part of the tribulation will occur.</content>

      <content> Notice that the day of the Lord does not overtake believers like a thief in the night; therefore, the faithful can know, to some extent, the future times and dates.</content>
