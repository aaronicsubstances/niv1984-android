      <content>We ought to give thanks always to God for you, brothers, in a fitting manner, because your faith is increasing greatly, and because the charity of each of you toward one another is abundant,</content>

      <content> The word &#8216;discessio&#8217; in this verse has long been understood in the Catholic Church to refer to the great apostasy, which occurs during the tribulation. And in as much as the tribulation is divided into two parts, then so also will there be two great apostasies, one during the first part of the tribulation, which is but a dim reflection of that more extensive great apostasy during the second part of the tribulation. The Antichrist, as one particular human person, is of the second part of the tribulation; he is not present in the world today.</content>

      <content> What is it that holds back the Antichrist from being in the present time? It is the holy Eucharist. In the generations preceding the arrival of the Antichrist, the Eucharist and the true Mass will be diminished extensively throughout the world, Christians will become a hated minority, and the world will immerse itself in every kind of sin, and in hatred for all true religion. This decline in truth and holiness occurs in the 24th century A.D., during the time of the ten kings. The birth of the Antichrist occurs in the very late 24th century, and his rise to power occurs in the early 25th century. His reign will be from 2430/2431 to 2437 A.D.</content>

      <content> The one who holds back the mystery of iniquity, so that it does not result in the actual arrival of the person of the Antichrist, is Christ present in the holy Eucharist. That is why the abomination of desolation, a false Eucharist is associated with the Antichrist. When the abomination replaces the Eucharist, then the Antichrist begins his reign of terror against the Church.</content>

    <note num="4">
      <content> As we learn from the Book of Revelation, the Antichrist is never killed, but he is sent alive, body and soul, with the false prophetess, into the destruction of Hellfire: &#8220;These two were cast alive into the pool of fire burning with sulphur.&#8221; (Rev 19:20). The word &#8216;interficiet&#8217; does not always refer to death per se.</content>
