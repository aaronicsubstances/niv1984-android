      <content>who has freed us and has called us to his holy vocation, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the ages of time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And this has now been made manifest by the illumination of our Savior Jesus Christ, who certainly has destroyed death, and who has also illuminated life and incorruption through the Gospel.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For this reason, I also suffer these things. But I am not confounded. For I know in whom I have believed, and I am certain that he has the power to preserve what was entrusted to me, unto that day.</content>

      <content> The term &#8216;sobrietatis&#8217; has a more general meaning in Latin than its counterpart in English. It does not refer merely to refraining from alcohol, but to self-restraint more generally.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> The term &#8216;all&#8217; is used here in the general sense, referring to the group as a whole. As the subsequent verses indicate, one or more individuals are exceptions to the general statement, not having turned away from Paul.</content>

      <content>Labor like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>No man, acting as a soldier for God, entangles himself in worldly matters, so that he may be pleasing to him for whom he has proven himself.</content>
