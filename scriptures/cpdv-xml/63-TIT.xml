      <content>For this reason, I left you behind in Crete: so that those things which are lacking, you would correct, and so that you would ordain, throughout the communities, priests, (just as I also ordained you)</content>

      <content>A certain one of these, a prophet of their own kind, said: &#8220;The Cretans are ever liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.&#8221;</content>

      <content>This testimony is true. Because of this, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,</content>

    <note num="1">
      <content> Married men were permitted, for a time, to become priests, because most Christians were converts in adulthood, so that the vast majority of men who might become priests were already married prior to converting. As for the term &#8216;filios,&#8217; it literally means &#8216;sons,&#8217; and, in those days, a father would generally teach his sons a trade and other things, whereas teaching daughters fell more to the mother; so the father would have authority and responsibility over all his children, but how good he was at raising his children would be seen more in the sons, than in the daughters. The term &#8216;filios&#8217; having the greater meaning of sons, and the lesser meaning of children, is fitting here, since the father has a greater responsibility for raising sons, but some responsibility for raising all the children.</content>

      <content> In the last days, entire religious houses will be subverted by false doctrine. This will occur to one extent during the first part of the tribulation, and to a greater extent during the second part of the tribulation.</content>

      <content> Winter was a difficult time for travel during the first century A.D. The Mediterranean was considered unfit for safe sailing, and travel by land was difficult, since winter is the rainy season. Also, during winter in that area of the world the temperatures can be below freezing at night.</content>
