      <content>And having been made so much better than the Angels, he has inherited a name so much greater than theirs.</content>

      <content>For to which of the Angels has he ever said: &#8220;You are my Son; today have I begotten you?&#8221; Or again: &#8220;I will be a Father to him, and he shall be a Son to me?&#8221;</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And about the Angels, certainly, he says: &#8220;He makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.&#8221;</content>

      <content>But about the Son: &#8220;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of equity.</content>

      <content>You have loved justice, and you have hated iniquity. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation, above your companions.&#8221;</content>

  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Hebrews 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For this reason, it is necessary for us to observe more thoroughly the things that we have heard, lest we let them slip away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if a word that was spoken through the Angels has been made firm, and every transgression and disobedience has received the recompense of a just retribution,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>in what way might we escape, if we neglect such a great salvation? For though initially it had begun to be described by the Lord, it was confirmed among us by those who heard him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>with God testifying to it by signs and wonders, and by various miracles, and by the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, in accord with his own will.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For God did not subject the future world, about which we are speaking, to the Angels.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But someone, in a certain place, has testified, saying: &#8220;What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the Son of man, that you visit him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>You have reduced him to a little less than the Angels. You have crowned him with glory and honor, and you have set him over the works of your hands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>You have subjected all things under his feet.&#8221; For in as much as he has subjected all things to him, he has left nothing not subject to him. But in the present time, we do not yet perceive that all things have been made subject to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Yet we understand that Jesus, who was reduced to a little less than the Angels, was crowned with glory and honor because of his Passion and death, in order that, by the grace of God, he might taste death for all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For it was fitting for him, because of whom and through whom all things exist, who had led many children into glory, to complete the authorship of their salvation through his Passion.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For he who sanctifies, and those who are sanctified, are all from One. For this reason, he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>&#8220;I will announce your name to my brothers. In the midst of the Church, I will praise you.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And again: &#8220;I will be faithful in him.&#8221; And again: &#8220;Behold, I and my children, whom God has given to me.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Therefore, because children have a common flesh and blood, he himself also, in like manner, has shared in the same, so that through death, he might destroy him who held the dominion of death, that is, the devil,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>and so that he might free those who, through the fear of death, had been condemned to servitude throughout their entire life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For at no time did he take hold of the Angels, but instead he took hold of the offspring of Abraham.</content>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>Therefore, it is fitting for him to be made similar to his brothers in all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful High Priest before God, in order that he might bring forgiveness to the offenses of the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For in as much as he himself has suffered and has been tempted, he also is able to assist those who are tempted.</content>

  <chapter num="3" preferred_title="Hebrews 3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>He is faithful to the One who made him, just as Moses also was, with his entire house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For this Jesus was considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, so much so that the house which he has built holds a greater honor than the former one.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For every house is built by someone, but God is the One who has created all things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And certainly Moses was faithful, with his entire house, like any servant, as a testimony to those things that would soon be said.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Yet truly, Christ is like a Son in his own house. We are that house, if we firmly retain the faithfulness and the glory of hope, even unto the end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Because of this, it is just as the Holy Spirit says: &#8220;If today you hear his voice,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, the very day of temptation, in the desert,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>where your fathers tested me, even though they had seen and examined my works for forty years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For this reason, I was enraged against this generation, and I said: They always wander astray in heart. For they have not known my ways.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>So it is as I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest!&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Be cautious, brothers, lest perhaps there may be, in any of you, an evil heart of unbelief, turning aside from the living God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Instead, exhort one another every day, while it is still called &#8216;today,&#8217; so that none of you may become hardened through the falseness of sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For we have been made participants in Christ. This is only so, if we firmly retain the beginning of his substance, even unto the end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For it has been said: &#8220;If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts, in the same manner as in the former provocation.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For some of those listening did provoke him. But not all of these had set forth from Egypt through Moses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So against whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not those who had sinned, whose dead bodies lay prostrate in the desert?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest, except to those who were incredulous?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And so, we perceive that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4" preferred_title="Hebrews 4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Therefore, we should be afraid, lest the promise of entering into his rest may be relinquished, and some of you may be judged to be lacking.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For this was announced to us in a similar manner as to them. But the mere hearing of the word did not benefit them, since it was not joined together with a faith in those things that they heard.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For we who have believed shall enter into rest, in the same manner as he said: &#8220;So it is as I have sworn in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest!&#8221; And certainly, this is when the works from the foundation of the world have been finished.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For, in a certain place, he spoke about the seventh day in this manner: &#8220;And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And in this place again: &#8220;They shall not enter into my rest!&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Therefore, this is because certain ones remain who are to enter into it, and those to whom it was announced first did not enter into it, because of unbelief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Again, he defines a certain day, after so much time, saying in David, &#8220;Today,&#8221; just as it was stated above, &#8220;If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For if Jesus had offered them rest, he would never have spoken, afterward, about another day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And so, there remains a Sabbath of rest for the people of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For whoever has entered into his rest, the same has also rested from his works, just as God did from his.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Therefore, let us hasten to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same example of unbelief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For the Word of God is living and effective: more piercing than any two-edged sword, reaching to the division even between the soul and the spirit, even between the joints and the marrow, and so it discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>And there is no created thing that is invisible to his sight. For all things are naked and open to the eyes of him, about whom we are speaking.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Therefore, since we have a great High Priest, who has pierced the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold to our confession.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to have compassion on our infirmities, but rather one who was tempted in all things, just as we are, yet without sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Therefore, let us go forth with confidence toward the throne of grace, so that we may obtain mercy, and find grace, in a helpful time.</content>
    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> In the ancient view of the human person, when body and soul are united, there exists spirit, that is, the breath of life, and those qualities that pertain to life and to the cooperation of body and soul, such as heart and mind and emotion, etc.</content>
    </note>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5" preferred_title="Hebrews 5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For every high priest, having been taken from among men, is appointed on behalf of men toward the things which pertain to God, so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>he is able to commiserate with those who are ignorant and who wander astray, because he himself is also encompassed by infirmity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And because of this, he also must make such offerings for sins even for himself, in the same manner as for the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Neither does anyone take up this honor himself, but rather he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Thus, even Christ did not glorify himself, so as to become High Priest, but instead, it was God who said to him: &#8220;You are my Son. Today I have begotten you.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And similarly, he says in another place: &#8220;You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>It is Christ who, in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offered prayers and supplications to the One who was able to save him from death, and who was heard because of his reverence.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And although, certainly, he is the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things that he suffered.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And having reached his consummation, he was made, for all who are obedient to him, the cause of eternal salvation,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>having been called by God to be the High Priest, according to the order of Melchizedek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Our message about him is great, and difficult to explain when speaking, because you have been made feeble when listening.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For even though it is the time when you ought to be teachers, you are still lacking, so that you must be taught the things that are the basic elements of the Word of God, and so you have been made like those who are in need of milk, and not of solid food.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For anyone who is still feeding on milk is still unskillful in the Word of Justice; for he is like an infant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But solid food is for those who are mature, for those who, by practice, have sharpened their mind, so as to discern good from evil.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6" preferred_title="Hebrews 6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Therefore, interrupting an explanation of the basics of Christ, let us consider what is more advanced, not presenting again the fundamentals of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>of the doctrine of baptism, and also of the imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>And we shall do this, if indeed God permits it.</content>
    </verse>

      <content> The word &#8216;nisi,&#8217; which usually means &#8216;except&#8217; or &#8216;unless&#8217; (or, literally, &#8216;if not&#8217;), in this context indicates an oath or a swearing to something. It is like saying, &#8220;If I do not do this thing that I swear to do (or, &#8220;Unless I do this thing that I swear to do&#8221;), then may that bad thing happen to me.&#8221; However, the latter part of stating the bad thing is left off, in this case because God cannot fail to accomplish what He has sworn, and because nothing bad can happen to God.</content>

      <content>Next, consider how great this man is, since the Patriarch Abraham even gave tithes to him from the principal things.</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>And indeed, those who are from the sons of Levi, having received the priesthood, hold a commandment to take tithes from the people in accord with the law, that is, from their brothers, even though they also went forth from the loins of Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But this man, whose lineage is not enumerated with them, received tithes from Abraham, and he blessed even the one who held the promises.</content>

      <content>Therefore, if consummation had occurred through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), then what further need would there be for another Priest to rise up according to the order of Melchizedek, one who was not called according to the order of Aaron?</content>

      <content> The verb &#8216;distenti sunt&#8217; indicates that this suffering is a punishment for offenses, in other words, a metaphor for Purgatory. So this part does not refer to an unjust persecution, nor to the unending suffering of Hell. For those in Purgatory suffer after death, yet find a better resurrection after their suffering. Literally, the verb refers to being racked (stretched out on a rack as an ancient form of severe punishment). The sufferings of Purgatory are more severe than any tortures of earth, although in Purgatory, the faithful souls there only have souls, not bodies, so their sufferings are spiritual only, not physical.</content>
