      <content> In Latin, when a sentence has a subject, and the next part of that same sentence has a subject, expressed in a pronoun, the second subject is generally the same as the first. So in &#8216;non potest peccare&#8217; (he is not able to sin), the subject is the same as of the previous verb &#8216;manet,&#8217; namely &#8216;semen ipsus&#8217; (the offspring of God). Therefore, we who have been born of God are able to avoid sin because we have he who absolutely cannot sin remaining in us. Those who commit actual mortal sins lose that presence of Christ and of His Spirit within them which is called sanctifying grace or the state of grace.</content>

      <content> The mere fact that a claimed prophet, or a claimed message to a claimed prophet, says that Jesus is the Son of God does not mean that the prophet is true. They may say with words that Jesus is God Incarnate, but then they go on to contradict or undermine His teachings, and so, in effect, they are denying his Incarnation.

    <note num="2">
      <content> Any kind of contradiction of the teachings of Jesus is, in effect, a denial of the Incarnation of God, even if those false teachers say with words that Jesus arrived as God Incarnate. The Antichrist, when he arrives in the distant future, will deny that Christ was God Incarnate. But many false ideas, in some way and to some degree, foreshadow the Antichrist, by contradicting or undermining various teachings of Christ. This attitude eventually leads to the arrival of the Antichrist, who denies all that is of Christ.</content>

      <content> This passage and its message is certainly consistent with the rest of the letter of John. Now there are various opinions about whether or not the author of the letters of John is the same as the author of the Gospel of John. My opinion is that the style of writing and the vocabulary show a different and later author. The lateness of the authorship of this letter explains how the passage about the Father, Word, and Spirit can have a more developed Trinitarian theology than the Gospel. However, those who claim that the passage is not genuine are ignoring its inherent consistency with the rest of the letter from the same author.</content>
