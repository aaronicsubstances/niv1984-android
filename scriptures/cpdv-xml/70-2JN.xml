    <verse num="5">
      <content>And now I petition you, Lady, not as if writing a new commandment to you, but instead that commandment which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another.</content>

      <content> These persons are foreshadowings of the false prophetess and the Antichrist. In denying that Jesus is God Incarnate and the Messiah, they prepare for the eventual arrival of the Antichrist in the distant future. In denying any of the teachings of Jesus, they are in effect denying that God became Incarnate. For if God became Incarnate in order to teach you something, how can you deny His teachings and still claim that He is God Incarnate?</content>
