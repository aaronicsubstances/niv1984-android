      <content>The Elder, to Gaius, most beloved, whom I love in the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Most beloved, concerning everything, I make it my prayer that you may benefit by advancing and succeeding in whatever may be to the benefit of your soul.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>I was very glad when the brothers arrived, and when they offered testimony to the truth in you, that you are walking in the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>I have no greater grace than this, when I hear that my sons are walking in the truth.</content>

      <content>Most beloved, you should act faithfully in whatever you do for the brothers, and those who are sojourners;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">

      <content>Therefore, we must accept such as these, in order that we may cooperate with the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>As it happens, I had written to the church. But Diotrephes, who loves to bear the highest rank among them, would not accept us.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>Because of this, when I come, I will admonish his works which he does, babbling against us with malicious words. And as if this were not sufficient for him, he himself does not receive the brothers. And those who do receive them, he hinders, and he ejects them from the church.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Most beloved, do not be willing to imitate what is evil; instead imitate what is good. Whoever does good is of God. Whoever does evil has not seen God.</content>

    <verse num="12">

    </verse>
    <note num="1">
      <content> The term &#8216;Gentiles&#8217; in this context refers, not to Christians who were not formerly Jews, but to unbelievers.</content>

    <note num="2">
      <content> John addresses this letter to an individual, Gaius, because a troublemaker in the Church was making it ineffective for him to write directly to the Church in that city.</content>
    </note>
    <note num="3">
      <content> It seems to me that John is not willing to trust everything to writing because there are troublemakers within the Church he is writing to, who might distort what he is saying, or who might not deliver it. Letters in past times were often hand delivered by some trusted person who was traveling to the same place. John seems to lack the ability to send someone who would be widely accepted to that Church.</content>
