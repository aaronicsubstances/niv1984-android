<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> This book is attributed to king Solomon, being based on his words of wisdom from God. Solomon is called Ecclesiastes because he calls the people to an assembly (ecclesia), so as to teach them wisdom.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Solomon is pointing out the emptiness of worldly things by themselves. The word ‘vanitas’ can also refer to emptiness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The repeated use of the phrase ‘under the sun’ indicates that this book is about this life, not about the next life in Heaven.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Though Scripture says that heaven and earth shall pass away, Scripture also says that God will create a new heaven and a new earth. Then the new heaven, as well as the new earth, stand forever.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The meridian is midday (i.e. the highest point that the sun reaches in the sky) or more generally the middle of the sky (i.e. neither horizon). The term meridian may also be translated as ‘south,’ referring to the fact that the sun is more to the south when viewed from locations in the northern hemisphere, such as Jerusalem. The sun then arcs more toward the north (but not actually north of due west); this is particularly evident in winter and at higher latitudes, where the sun is fairly low in the southern sky about midday, and then arcs more toward the north as it sets.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> The word ‘cunctae’ is not as all inclusive as ‘universae,’ hence the translation ‘such things.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> This verse prophetically indicates that, during the last days, the world will have a disdain for, and a rejection of, true historical information.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-8' href='#cpdv-verse-1-8'>h</a>. <span> The wiser one becomes, the more one realizes how much foolishness is in the world, resulting in a righteous anger or indignation; this is a burden to those who attain wisdom.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-29'>Ecclesiastes 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I said in my heart: “I will go forth and overflow with delights, and I will enjoy good things.” And I saw that this, too, is emptiness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Laughter, I considered an error. And to rejoicing, I said: “Why are you being deceived, to no purpose?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I decided in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, so that I might bring my mind to wisdom, and turn away from foolishness, until I see what is useful for the sons of men, and what they ought to do under the sun, during the number of the days of their life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I magnified my works. I built houses for myself, and I planted vineyards.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I made gardens and orchards. And I planted them with trees of every kind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And I dug out fishponds of water, so that I might irrigate the forest of growing trees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I obtained men and women servants, and I had a great family, as well as herds of cattle and great flocks of sheep, beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I amassed for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings and governors. I chose men and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, bowls and pitchers for the purpose of pouring wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I surpassed in opulence all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also persevered with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And all that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them. Neither did I prohibit my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and from amusing itself in the things that I had prepared. And I regarded this as my share, as if I were making use of my own labors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when I turned myself toward all the works that my hands had made, and to the labors in which I had perspired to no purpose, I saw emptiness and affliction of the soul in all things, and that nothing is permanent under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I continued on, so as to contemplate wisdom, as well as error and foolishness. “What is man,” I said, “that he would be able to follow his Maker, the King?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And I saw that wisdom surpasses foolishness, so much so that they differ as much as light from darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The eyes of a wise man are in his head. A foolish man walks in darkness. Yet I learned that one would pass away like the other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I said in my heart: “If the death of both the foolish and myself will be one, how does it benefit me, if I have given myself more thoroughly to the work of wisdom?” And as I was speaking within my own mind, I perceived that this, too, is emptiness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For there will not be a remembrance in perpetuity of the wise, nor of the foolish. And the future times will cover everything together, with oblivion. The learned die in a manner similar to the unlearned.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And, because of this, my life wearied me, since I saw that everything under the sun is evil, and everything is empty and an affliction of the spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Again, I detested all my efforts, by which I had earnestly labored under the sun, to be taken up by an heir after me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>though I know not whether he will be wise or foolish. And yet he will have power over my labors, in which I have toiled and been anxious. And is there anything else so empty?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore, I ceased, and my heart renounced further laboring under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For when someone labors in wisdom, and doctrine, and prudence, he leaves behind what he has obtained to one who is idle. So this, too, is emptiness and a great burden.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-2" id="cpdv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For how can a man benefit from all his labor and affliction of spirit, by which he has been tormented under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>All his days have been filled with sorrows and hardships; neither does he rest his mind, even in the night. And is this not emptiness?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Is it not better to eat and drink, and to show his soul the good things of his labors? And this is from the hand of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So who will feast and overflow with delights as much as I have?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>God has given, to the man who is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and rejoicing. But to the sinner, he has given affliction and needless worrying, so as to add, and to gather, and to deliver, to him who has pleased God. But this, too, is emptiness and a hollow worrying of the mind.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-58'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The lack of remembrance of the wise pertains to the world, not to heaven and the kingdom of God. Those immersed in the world choose to forget the past and its lessons, lest they be corrected and have to give up the sins that they love. This verse is also prophetic; in the last days, the world will forget, or cover over, or teach falsehoods about various events in the past which would have corrected their errors. They will cover past truths with the oblivion of their sinfulness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘malum’ does not always mean ‘evil;’ it also refers to things that are very difficult or burdensome, and to things that are harmful.</span></div>
