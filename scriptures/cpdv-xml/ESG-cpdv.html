<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> In Biblical times, the term “India” did not refer to the subcontinent of India, as we call it today. Rather it referred to various areas east of the Red Sea, including Arabia, Persia, and Parthia, but not present-day India.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> The word exordium, is actually “from the beginning.” The word implies the root, origins, dawning, rising, threshold, or starting point of something. Susa is the beginning of his kingdom, or the threshold of his kingdom.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> Convivium literally means living together, or, (more loosely, but, in this context, more accurately)  rejoicing together. The concept of food is not intrinsic to the word, even though it is usually translated as feast or similarly. The word perhaps derives from the idea that a group of people who gathered for a feast or celebration would spend several days or longer living and rejoicing in the same place.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> Nemoris is a forest, but in this context it is clearly a planted and cultivated area of trees, i.e. an arboretum.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-5' href='#cpdv-verse-3-5'>e</a>. <span> Purple, purpureis, refers to that ancient and very expensive purple dye used by royalty and the very wealthy.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-6' href='#cpdv-verse-3-6'>f</a>. <span> This other feast for the women was in the queen’s palace, not the king’s palace. Apparently, the king would sleep with the queen at her palace, not his.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-7' href='#cpdv-verse-3-7'>g</a>. <span> Note that husbands are greater rulers in their house than their wives. “Viros principes ac maiores in domibus suis” could be translated as, “husbands are leaders and greater in their own houses,” but the phrase “greater rulers” is more succinct and makes for a better translation. Maiores is comparative, meaning greater, not great.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-1' href='#cpdv-verse-5-1'>a</a>. <span> It is not clear from the wording of the text whether this “imperator” is the king or Haman. Imperator can mean emperor or it can mean a ruler or general. Perhaps the text is making fun of Haman, who is only a ruler, but who acts as if he were an emperor.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-2' href='#cpdv-verse-5-2'>b</a>. <span> Novis can mean new, or it can mean strange or unusual. In this context, the laws of the Jews are seen as strange or unusual to the Persians, not as merely new.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-3' href='#cpdv-verse-5-3'>c</a>. <span> Appendam means to weigh, but it also means to hang (as to hang on a balance or scale when weighing).

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-4' href='#cpdv-verse-5-4'>d</a>. <span> The Latin vulgate places those verses found in the Greek version of Esther at the end of the book, after those verses found in the Hebrew. This places some of the text out of narrative order:
<br>
“... et diriperent bona, vel substantias eorum.”  This last part of verse 5:13 is a correction, based on the Latin Vulgate, which has both “... et bona eorum diriperent.” (3:13 Vulgate numbering) and a separate verse “Et diripuerunt bona, vel substantias eorum.” (12:6b Vulgate numbering). This separate verse does not fit into the narrative in its place in the Vulgate arrangement. Its only reasonable fit into the narrative is in this place in the text, as an emendation indicating that the Jews enemies planned to plunder not only their wealth, but also their most basic possessions. The verse does not fit into verses 12:11 or 14:10 (new numbering), because the king’s just order would not ask the Jews to take even the necessities of their enemies (which might go to surviving relatives in need) and also because the Jews decided not to avail themselves of the option of taking the spoils at all.</span></div>

This point is relevant to the translation of verse 8:2, when Esther does similarly. The phrase “in platea mediæ civitatis” refers to a wide street in the middle of the city.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-4' href='#cpdv-verse-7-4'>d</a>. <span> The phrase “dierum humilitatis tuæ” refers to the time when Esther was a lowly commoner, not the queen of the Persian empire. The phrase “nutrita sis in manu mea” refers to the time when Esther was raised or nurtured by Mordecai. The word “sis” indicates a figure of speech: “as if in my hand.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-5' href='#cpdv-verse-7-5'>e</a>. <span> Verse 7:16 (which is 15:1 in the Latin Vulgate) is often omitted from English versions of Esther, even though it is consistently found in the Clementine Latin Vulgate.

The correct understanding of this text leads to a more accurate, but less literal translation. In some arid lands, where there are not many trees to use as fuel for fires, people use dried animal dung to burn for their fires. Esther took ashes from such a fire and put them on her head.

Insidias refers to treachery or a plot or an ambush.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-2' href='#cpdv-verse-13-2'>b</a>. <span> The word cernentis means to sift or to distinguish or to discern. In this translation, the well-known phrase “sifting judgment of God” is fittingly applied.</span></div>
