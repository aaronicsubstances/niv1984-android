<div id='cpdv-bookmark-46-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Heaven was created first, then earth. The creation of angels also occurred with the creation of heaven. The creation of earth is really the creation of the universe, and subsequently earth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> After earth was created, it was empty and unoccupied. Darkness is plural in the Latin. This could symbolize fallen angels, with the abyss symbolizing Hell. The word ‘darknesses’ can also refer to the absences of so many good things, so that God had to continue creating. The Spirit of God was brought or was carried over the waters, passive tense.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> God created light. Darkness, as the absence of light, became by default. Similarly with evil. God created the heavens and the angels, but some angels fell and so Hell (the abyss) was created.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> God divided light from darkness. He also divided Heaven from Hell, once Hell was created (or became necessary due to the angels that fell from grace). Notice that God chooses to create Heaven and Earth (Universe), but Hell comes about as a result of sin. God creates Good, but Evil comes about because of sin. God does not directly create evil or darkness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The first day is not a day as we count time, but merely the first period of time, of unspecified length, in the universe. Science agrees that first the Universe was created, and there was no life in the first time period, for the Universe was void and unoccupied. And when the earth first became, it was void and lifeless.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> This verse introduces a useful ambiguity, whereby the word ‘terra’ can refer to the entire Earth, or to the land (soil or ground), or to a particular land, e.g. ‘Terram Chanaan.’ A similar ambiguity exists with the word ‘caeli’ referring either to Heaven, or to the sky.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> Notice that God commands the earth to produce plant-life (‘herbam virentem’). He miraculously created heaven and earth out of nothing, but he causes the plant-life to be produced out of what already exists, the land. This text supports the idea, found in science, that life developed from existing inanimate matter. But the text also clearly teaches the truth that the entire process of creation and the development of creation is caused by God and is under His Providence.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-8' href='#cpdv-verse-1-8'>h</a>. <span> The word ‘genus’ from verse 11 is more general than the word ‘speciem’ in verse 12. The fruit-bearing trees have their seed within the fruit, and each particular type of fruit has its own type of seed and manner of sowing.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-9' href='#cpdv-verse-1-9'>i</a>. <span> In this next step within the development of creation, God creates the first creatures that have living souls (but not immortal souls) within the sea. Again, science agrees, teaching that the first animals were in the water, not on the land. The word ‘reptile’ in Latin is not equivalent to the English word ‘reptile.’ The best translation in this context is probably either ‘moving creatures’ or ‘animals.’ The text is contrasting the moving creatures of the waters with the plants.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-10' href='#cpdv-verse-1-10'>j</a>. <span> The word ‘cete’ in ancient times was probably not specific to whales, but referred to any large sea creature.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-11' href='#cpdv-verse-1-11'>k</a>. <span> Again, the word ‘genere’ is more general, while the word ‘species’ is more specific. If these two words were translated by the same word in English, then there would be an unnecessary redundancy in the text. And here again we see that ‘reptile’ is not specifically reptiles, or even crawling things, but is even more general, referring to every type of moving creature (animal) on land. These creatures are contrasted with the moving creatures of the waters, as well as the plants, of the previous verses. Therefore, the term is more general than crawling things. The mention of cattle and wild beasts are merely specific examples of familiar types of moving creatures, with living souls, on land.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-12' href='#cpdv-verse-1-12'>l</a>. <span> So, plants were the first life created, then moving creatures of the sea, then moving creatures of the land. This is the same order of development in creation taught by science (although Scripture omits mention of microscopic organisms, with which the ancients were unfamiliar).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-13' href='#cpdv-verse-1-13'>m</a>. <span> The word ‘hominem’ in this verse is not capitalized, whereas in the previous verse it is capitalized. The previous verse uses Man (capitalized) to refer to all humankind; the male word ‘man’ is used to refer to all of humanity because, in God’s plan, the human race is to be led by men. This verse uses man (not capitalized) to refer to humankind, with a particular emphasis on males. All human persons are created in God’s image and likeness. Yet, when men and women are considered in their relation to one another, men are an image of God and women are an image of Creation.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> Augustine and others say that this passage refers to the lineages of Seth and Cain, the one being holy and close to God, and the other living apart from God. My suggestion is a more generalized version of what Augustine said, namely, that the sons of God are those who stayed close to God in their lives, and the sons of men are those who lived merely secular lives. In the Bible, the term 'sons of' does not necessarily connotate lineage. For example, those who commit adultery are called, 'sons of adulterers,' not because their parents were also adulterers, but because they act as if they were sons of adultery personified. There were, in ancient times, prior to any organized religion as we have today, some who were holy, who lived close to God, and who, as a result, lived long lives. But these sons of God were attracted to women who were not holy, who lived secular lives. Thus God generally limits the length of our lives because of sin.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> The giants were perhaps those who were giants in their mental stature, not so much in their physical stature. There may also have been stark differences in the physical characteristics of different groups of people, due to small gene pools, in groups separated by tribe or lineage. Some groups may have been markedly larger or stronger than others. The sons of the sons of God and the daughters of men were mighty because God blesses the offspring of those who are holy.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-3' href='#cpdv-verse-6-3'>c</a>. <span> Even though Noah lived among in evil generation, he was well-thought of and successful among them, because he walked with God. This verse also has the sense that Noah was predominate among his own family and descendents because he walked with God. And it also means that Noah was uncorrupted by his time.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-4' href='#cpdv-verse-6-4'>d</a>. <span> So, the top of the window was placed so that it would be within a cubit of the summit of the arc. Then Noah could see a greater distance from the window than if it were placed lower, and it would be less susceptible to leaks from waves hitting the window.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-5' href='#cpdv-verse-6-5'>e</a>. <span> This verse does not yet say how many pairs, but merely instructs that every living creature placed on the ark should be in pair, male and female. This passage teaches us that human persons, as well as all other animals, are intended by God to be in pairs</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-2' href='#cpdv-verse-9-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘requiram’ has more the sense of ‘examine,’ than of ‘require,’ especially in this context. The repetition of the word man, using both ‘hominis’ and ‘viri,’ indicates that the first usage applies to mankind.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-3' href='#cpdv-verse-9-3'>c</a>. <span> God tells mankind not only to ‘replete’ (fill) the earth, as the animals do, but also to ‘implete’ (fulfill or complete) the earth, as only mankind can do.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-5' href='#cpdv-verse-9-5'>e</a>. <span> Here is an interesting use of the word ‘vir.’ The word ‘vir’ usually is translated as ‘man,’ or in some contexts as ‘husband.’ However, it is derived from the word meaning virtuous or powerful, so it often has a further connotation: not any man, but a good man or a powerful man. In the context of the phrase ‘vir agricola,’ the word vir, though a noun, has more of the effect of an adjective: ‘a good farmer.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-6' href='#cpdv-verse-9-6'>f</a>. <span> What Ham, the father of Canaan, did was symbolic of the sins of Canaan, various sins beginning with immodesty, which began with Ham, and extending on to the much more serious sexual sins and idolatrous practices of Canaan.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-1' href='#cpdv-verse-18-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘adoravit’ in Latin does not always refer to adoration; it can also refer to treating someone with reverence or respect.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-2' href='#cpdv-verse-18-2'>b</a>. <span> Because ‘lavate’ and ‘requiescite’ are imperative, it implies that the washing of the feet will be done by the visitors, not by Abram. Otherwise, the verb would have been indicative first person singular.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-3' href='#cpdv-verse-18-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘sata’ refers to something that is cultivated, as opposed to grain that is wild. There is also a strong implication that it was cultivated locally, that is, by the servants of Abraham; it was not bought, but home-grown. This could be translated as ‘home-grown wheat flour,’ but it is usually translated as ‘the finest wheat flour,’ since wheat has a strong symbolic connection to the Eucharist, the finest Sacrament.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-4' href='#cpdv-verse-18-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘subcinericios’ probably refers to an ancient type of heat retention cooking, where loaves were placed under the ashes of a fire to bake.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-5' href='#cpdv-verse-18-5'>e</a>. <span> The phrase ‘vita comite’ literally means ‘with life as a companion.’ Wycliffe translates this as ‘if I live.’ But other translations see it as referring to the time of his return, the springtime. The phrase, in this context, has a dual meaning. It refers to the springtime: life springing up when he returns, as if his companion. It also refers to the life in Sarah’s womb, for this new life’s birth will coincide with his return.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-6' href='#cpdv-verse-18-6'>f</a>. <span> The Douay-Rheims versions have ‘I shall return,’ but the text says ‘he shall return,’ using the third person singular.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-7' href='#cpdv-verse-18-7'>g</a>. <span> Scripture is explaining God’s actions in human terms, as a figure of speech, because it is difficult to describe or even imagine the fullness of Eternity and Knowledge found in God. Scripture is not saying that God could not know without going down to investigate.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-8' href='#cpdv-verse-18-8'>h</a>. <span> Abraham traveled, but he still was, in a manner of speaking always standing in front of the Lord.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-9' href='#cpdv-verse-18-9'>i</a>. <span> Too many different words in Latin are all typically translated with the English word ‘destroy.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-711-24-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he said to the elder servant of his house, who was in charge of all that he had: “Place your hand under my thigh,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-734-24-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And she continued, saying, “There is very much straw and hay with us, and a spacious place to stay.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-735-24-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The man bowed himself down, and he adored the Lord,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-825-26-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he was questioned by the men of that place about his wife, he answered, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to confess her to be his mate, thinking that perhaps they would put him to death because of her beauty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-826-26-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when very many days had passed, and he had remained in the same place, Abimelech, king of the Palestinians, gazing through a window, saw him being playful with Rebekah, his wife.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-840-26-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then they dug up yet another one. And over that one also they fought, and he called it, ‘Enmity.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-844-26-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And so he built an altar there. And he invoked the name of the Lord, and he stretched out his tent. And he instructed his servants to dig a well.</span></div>

It refers to water that continually pours forth (perhaps similar to an artesian well). It also has a spiritual meaning, as found in the Gospels. The torrent is a wadi, in other words, a dry stream bed that is a rushing torrent in the rainy season (perhaps only one or two months a year). The word torrentem in Latin can refer to something that is hot and dry, or to a rushing stream.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-30-2' href='#cpdv-verse-30-2'>b</a>. <span> Also, in this case, the term ‘conceptum’ refers to the entire process of conception, pregnancy, and birthing.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-30-3' href='#cpdv-verse-30-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘praeripueris’ in this context refers to Rachel usurping Leah’s place as wife, for Leah was his first wife, but Rachel was first in his heart. The mandrake is a plant with a narcotic and soporific effect.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-1' href='#cpdv-verse-31-1'>a</a>. <span> The Angel says, ‘I am the God of Bethel....’ because the Angel was sent to convey God’s words to Jacob. In ancient times, when one wanted to convey a message to someone, one would send another person, usually a youth, to that someone to repeat your words to them. So it made perfect sense to Jacob that God would send an Angel (a messenger of God) convey a message by repeating God’s words to Jacob.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-2' href='#cpdv-verse-31-2'>b</a>. <span> Here is a verse whereby the Bible comments on its own translation, permitting an event to be described with varied wording, as best fits the language into which it is translated. Also, note that what each one chooses to call it reveals his attitude towards the agreement. Laban’s ‘tumulum’ can be translated as ‘tomb’ (cf. Job 10:19). Laban was losing his daughters, flocks, and son-in-law (a valuable employee); this loss was like a kind of death to him. But Jacob thought little of this agreement, for it was merely an agreement to let him have what was already justly his. So he calls it ‘acervum,’ which means ‘little hill’ or ‘pile’ or ‘heap.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-3' href='#cpdv-verse-31-3'>c</a>. <span> The verb ‘respicit’ does not merely mean ‘to see.’ It means to see and understand, or to look with the intention of understanding. And the word ‘praesens’ is the word ‘sens’ (a form of the verb ‘to be’) and the prefix ‘prae’ which means ‘before.’ As a phrase taken as a whole, and in this context, ‘præsens respicit’ means to understand beforehand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1479-43-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Likewise, Judah said to his father: “Send the boy with me, so that we may set out and be able to live, lest we and our little ones should die.</span></div>

Ordinarily, they would save some seed from one crop in order to grow the next crop. But the famine was caused by an inability to grow crops, almost certainly due to a lack of rain. This drought would reduce the amount of crops that could be grown to the extent that they could not (or would not) save some seed for the next crop. The drought would also keep the Nile from flooding its banks (which would have provided water and rich soil for crops grown in the flood plain).</span></div>
