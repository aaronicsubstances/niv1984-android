<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The words 'Deus' and 'Verbum' are both in the nominative case, so the text could be read as 'God was the Word,' or as 'the Word was God.'
<br>
However, word order in Latin is not entirely irrelevant, therefore this translation prefers ‘God was the Word,’ over ‘the Word was God.’ The same translation choice is made in the original Rheims New Testament of 1582.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Deus, Verbum, Vita represents Father, Son, Spirit.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The darkness represents the fallen angels and all evil in the world, which cannot understand the light of goodness. Notice that the light shines in the present tense, which is the closest tense to the timelessness of the Eternity of God, but the darkness is spoken of using the past tense, because fallen angels are trapped in Time.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> On one level of meaning, ‘ante me factus est’ means ‘ranks ahead of me.’ But there are other levels of meaning which that translation obscures. This is a frequent translation dilemma: one translation makes one level of meaning clearer, and other levels of meaning more obscure.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> This verse (particularly the last phrase) has several levels of meaning, and is somewhat obscure. This translation does not try to clear up every obscurity in Scripture, nor does it try to decide between various levels of meaning. On one level, it means that we have received grace upon grace; on another level, it means that we need grace from Christ for everything we do, even our cooperation with grace is a grace. And it seems to me that there are other levels of meaning also.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> I believe that John originally wrote his Gospel in Aramaic, the same language that Jesus most often used to teach, and that later John’s disciples translated it into Greek and added to it. That is why there are repeated references in the text saying ‘which is translated as.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> He was able to perceive the truth so readily because there was no deceit in him.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘Solvite’ is not so much ‘destroy’ as it is to loosen or release or set free.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> The length of time, 46 years, is divided into 40 plus 6 providentially. The 46 years is counted as the 46th Passover since the completion of the rebuilding of the Temple Sanctuary, which took 1.5 years. Josephus tell us that the Temple more generally, not merely the Sanctuary alone, took 8 years. Subtracting 1.5 years gives us 6.5 years: the length of time from the completion of the Sanctuary (at which time the rebuilt Temple was consecrated to God and the count of the years began) to the completion of the other buildings related to the Sanctuary. Then 40 more years are counted until Christ cleansed the temple by driving out the buyers and sellers.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> Since Jesus was referring to his body as a temple, of which the temple building is merely a symbol, this passage also refers symbolically to the length of time since the Immaculate Conception. This was now the 46th Passover since the Immaculate Conception, when God began to build the temple of Christ’s body by first building the temple of Mary’s body, in which God dwelt for 9 months (in the womb).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-245-6-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And a great multitude was following him, for they saw the signs that he was accomplishing toward those who were infirm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-246-6-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus went onto a mountain, and he sat down there with his disciples.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-248-6-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And so, when Jesus had lifted up his eyes and had seen that a very great multitude came to him, he said to Philip, “From where should we buy bread, so that these may eat?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-254-6-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus took the bread, and when he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting down to eat; similarly also, from the fish, as much as they wanted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-255-6-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then, when they were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather the fragments that are left over, lest they be lost.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-1' href='#cpdv-verse-7-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘ventre’ is a general term in Latin used to refer to the inner organs, or the inner parts of the body. It is used metaphorically in many instances. It can be properly translated as ‘belly’ or ‘heart’ or ‘inner self’ or ‘chest.’ In this case, the living waters that flow from Christ’s chest, flow from the wound in his side. This event is a living symbol of the graces that flow from the Sacraments.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-2' href='#cpdv-verse-7-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘Pontifices’ is the plural of ‘Pontifex,’ which means high priest. The word is used in the plural because there was one high priest, plus a former high priest who had been deposed by the Romans. But both wielded authority over the Jews, because the position of high priest was supposed to be for life.</span></div>

Perhaps this man spoke Latin, rather than the more common Aramaic. As a blind man, he would have been considered to be blind as a punishment for sin, and would therefore be excluded from being taught by the Jewish priests. So he would not have learned much Hebrew. Being excluded, to some extent, from Jewish society, he may have favored Latin as his spoken language. His other quoted words also sound very natural in Latin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-577-11-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Therefore, many of the Jews, who had come to Mary and Martha, and who had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-583-11-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Yet he did not say this from himself, but since he was the high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-592-12-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethania, where Lazarus had died, whom Jesus raised up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-593-12-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And they made a dinner for him there. And Martha was ministering. And truly, Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at table with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-597-12-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now he said this, not out of concern for the needy, but because he was a thief and, since he held the purse, he used to carry what was put into it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-598-12-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But Jesus said: “Permit her, so that she may keep it against the day of my burial.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-606-12-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Jesus found a small donkey, and he sat upon it, just as it is written:</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-21-2' href='#cpdv-verse-21-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that the verb tense is active not passive. Jesus has the power, as the Son of God, to raise himself up from the dead. At the general resurrection, we shall all be resurrected from the dead (passive tense) by Christ. But at His own resurrection, Christ resurrected himself from the dead (active tense).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-21-3' href='#cpdv-verse-21-3'>c</a>. <span> All the Apostles were martyred except John. This is a foreshadowing of the last days before the Return of Christ, when almost the whole Church will suffer severe persecution, but one part will be spared, so that the Church will not pass away prior to Christ’s return.</span></div>
