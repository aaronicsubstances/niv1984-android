<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> This verse has been translated more loosely because a strict translation would obscure the meaning of the verse. The virgin is actually a betrothed virgin; she has married a man, but she is still a virgin because, according to ancient custom, they have not moved in together right away. He died and so she is mourning in sackcloth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The implication is that only those priests who are true ministers of the Lord have mourned at the loss of sacrifice and libation. The Catholic interpretation of ‘sacrifice and libation’ is the bread and wine of the Eucharist.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Again, the Catholic understanding of this verse and its meaning for the Church is that the wheat and wine refers to the Eucharist and the oil refers to the Sacraments that make use of oil (such as Ordination).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> The vineyard workers (or vintners) wail over the fruit of the vine, because that is their work, and over the barley, because that is their food. In Biblical times, barley was the food of the working poor. The text implies that the ‘frumento’ is the crop of the ‘vinitores,’ so the use of ‘their’ in the translation is fitting.</span></div>

<div id='cpdv-bookmark-72-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The pronoun used in the Latin to refer to the ‘numerous and strong people’ of the previous verse is singular in Latin. However, in English, when we use a pronoun to refer to a group, we use the plural. For example: a group of people entered the building, and they sat down. So ‘eum’ is translated in the plural here.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> There are two ideas expressed in the last part of this verse. The first refers to the reaction of each person and their facial expression, which becomes withdrawn or driven back, as if into a jar. The second meaning refers to the losses in battle of those who oppose them. Their appearance (in battle) is driven back as if into a jar. All opposition is driven back by them, whether personal opposition shown even by facial expression, or forceful opposition with weapons.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> This entire passage can be interpreted to refer to the coming war (World War III) between the Arab nations of the Middle East and the Western nations (U.S. and Europe). It can also refer to much later battles, whereby the Antichrist conquers the world.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> Literally, the text says, ‘they will fall through the windows,’ but the context is warfare, so the translation uses ‘drop’ instead of ‘fall’ and ‘breach’ instead of ‘window.’ In other words, during battle, they will break through the breach point (narrow opening) in order to advance militarily.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> Here the text does not say that the sun and the moon go dark, but are lessened in their light. Similarly, the stars do not go dark, they reduce their shining beauty.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> Or, ‘excelling over ill will.’ Or, ‘....steadfastly rising above ill will.’ Or, ‘excelling above malice.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-7' href='#cpdv-verse-2-7'>g</a>. <span> In the Christian view of this text, the ‘Gentiles’ are those who are non-Christian and non-Jews, those who do not believe in the teachings of the Bible. And grain, wine, and oil represent the Sacraments, which make use of these things.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-8' href='#cpdv-verse-2-8'>h</a>. <span> This verse is about the Antichrist, who will first take power in the kingdom of the North (as the Book of Daniel says). The phrase ‘extremum eius ad mare novissimum’ could be interpreted to mean ‘with his back towards the furthest sea.’ The word ‘novissimum’ can mean ‘newest,’ but it can also mean furthest, since the newest troops are the last in the line of troops and the furthest away. This phrase is something of a play on words, since his furthest part, his extremity, is towards the furthest sea.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-9' href='#cpdv-verse-2-9'>i</a>. <span> This last phrase does not actually say, ‘For the Lord has done great things.’ It says, ‘because the Lord has greatly esteemed that which he has done.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-10' href='#cpdv-verse-2-10'>j</a>. <span> Or, ‘The fig tree and the vine have given their strength.’ The virtue of the fig tree and the vine is in their fruits, but these are also symbols of the true fruits of Creation, such as virtue and the other gifts of God’s grace.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-11' href='#cpdv-verse-2-11'>k</a>. <span> In Israel, it rains a little in the fall and a little in the spring. Most of the rain falls in the winter. The early and late rains, at the start and finish of the planting season (from fall to spring) can make the difference between a crop that succeeds and one that fails.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-12' href='#cpdv-verse-2-12'>l</a>. <span> Here is an example of a verse where the Challoner Douay-Rheims version translation refers to men: ‘old men,’ and ‘young men,’ but the text itself is fairly gender inclusive. The word ‘senes’ is masculine, but if the text wanted to refer specifically to men, it could easily have been worded with the word ‘vir.’ And the same can be said for ‘juvenes,’ (juveniles or youths). This translation (the CPDV) is certainly NOT an inclusive language or gender neutral version. Instead, the text is translated with whatever words most closely fit the Latin text, even if at times it
<br>
might seem to be inclusive language. Notice also that the text actually says ‘sons and daughters’ in the Latin. Therefore, when the text only says ‘sons,’ a translation of ‘sons and daughters’ or ‘people’ would not be justified.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> In this context, and in the Christian interpretation, ‘Gentes’ refers to secular society and to the nations, or that portion of any nation, that does not worship God devoutly.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> In the above verses (3:6 and 3:8), note the use of the words ‘filios’ (sons) and ‘filias’ (daughters). A translation of ‘filios’ into ‘children’ is not justified because the text does use ‘daughters’ when daughters are being described. And although ‘filiis’ could be either first declension feminine plural or second declension masculine plural, the context makes the translation of ‘sons’ more likely than ‘daughters.’ Note that there is a different word in Latin (pueri) used to refer to children of both genders. Alternately, when specifying children of both genders, the text will sometimes use both ‘filios’ and ‘filias’ as in verse 3:8 above.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> Yes, it actually says and means ‘sanctify a war,’ though some translations, not liking this meaning, obscure it with some alternate wording.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘circuitu’ refers to a revolution or a course or an area around something. It is also sometimes used in Latin to refer to the world or the heavens. In this context, and in the context of the Christian faith, it refers to the nations of the world.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-5' href='#cpdv-verse-3-5'>e</a>. <span> Numerous translations have this as ‘the valley of decision.’ This is not at all what the Latin text says. The Douay-Rheims at least has it somewhat right as ‘the valley of destruction.’ More precisely, cutting right to the heart of the matter, the word ‘concisionis’ refers to cutting or dividing something into pieces. In verse 3:2, God complains ‘for they have scattered them among the nations and have divided my land.’ This verse also references the valley of Jehoshaphat. So, verse 14 gives us a play on words. They have scattered and divided, so now they will be divided into pieces. Also, ‘iuxta’ in this verse does not mean ‘near.’ It means ‘according to’ or ‘accordingly’ or ‘fittingly.’ In other words, they are cut to pieces according to the way that they have treated God’s people, scattering them and dividing their land.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-6' href='#cpdv-verse-3-6'>f</a>. <span> In this case, the word ‘torrentem’ does not mean a torrent (as in a rushing stream or river), but instead refers to a dry, parched, scorched, or burning place, i.e. and arid land or a desert.</span></div>
