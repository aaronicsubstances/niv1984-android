<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>ALEPH. O how a city once filled with people now sits alone! The Governess of the Gentiles has become like a widow. The Prince of the provinces has been placed under tribute.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>BETH. Weeping, she has wept through the night, and her tears are on her cheeks. There is no one to be a comfort to her and to all her beloved. All her friends have spurned her, and they have become her enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>GHIMEL. Judah has migrated because of affliction and great servitude. She has lived among the nations and not found rest. All of her persecutors have apprehended her, amid torments.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>DALETH. The pathways of Zion mourn, because there are none who approach for the solemnity.

Jerusalem has remembered the days of her affliction and the betrayal of all her desirable ones, whom she held from the days of antiquity, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and there was no one to be a helper. The enemies have looked upon her and mocked her Sabbaths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>HETH. Jerusalem has sinned a grievous sin. Because of this, she has become unstable.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>SIN. They have heard that I groan and that there is no one to console me.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>THAU. Let all their evil enter before you. And make vintage of them, just as you made vintage of me, because of all my iniquities. For my sighs are many, and my heart is grieving.</span></div>
