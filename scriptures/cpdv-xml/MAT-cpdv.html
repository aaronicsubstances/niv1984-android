<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Notice that after many uses of the formula ‘one man conceived another man,’ the passage does not say that Joseph conceived (genuit) Jesus. The break in this formula indicates the understanding of Matthew and of the Church from its earliest days, that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The expression ‘in utero habebit’ literally means ‘shall have in the womb.’ But this verse is a quote from Isaiah 7:14, which, in the Latin, uses ‘virgo concipiet’ rather than ‘in utero habebit.’ Therefore, the use of the translation ‘shall conceive in her womb’ to convey the expression ‘shall have in the womb’ is justified. Verse 18 which has a similar expression, with a similar translation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And getting up, he took the boy and his mother by night, and withdrew into Egypt.</span></div>

The star did not merely continue to lead them forward, but it also descended as it led them through Bethlehem. Otherwise, they could not have known from a star (or comet) which location within Bethlehem was correct.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that the words ‘ploratus, plorans’ are translated differently, as ‘weeping, crying.’ It sometimes happens that the same word used twice is translated by two different words in English, or that two different words in Latin are translated by the same word in English. To translated the same word in Latin by always the same word in English would result in a translation that was, at best, stilted, and, at worst, inaccurate or incorrect.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘me’ is used instead of the grammatically correct ‘than I’ because it sounds more natural in English and because it makes a better parallel with the phrase ‘after me’. Even though the verse literally says ‘and fire,’ the word ‘et’ is sometimes used in Latin in a way that it is not used in English, to combine two qualities of the same thing.

Similarly, if a man is angry with his brother, he is liable to judgment to determine if he is sinning by his anger, or if his brother is guilty (as in cases of righteous anger). The same applies to the other two cases. Calling someone a name (or, to the same effect, accusing someone of something) makes one liable to judgment. As it is said in the secular courts, the truth is an effective defense against accusations of slander. So the judgment is to determine if the accusation is true, in which case the judgment would be not guilty.</span></div>

He then remained dead to the world for Friday night (the second night) and Saturday daytime (the second day) as well as Saturday night (the third night).

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-19-1' href='#cpdv-verse-19-1'>a</a>. <span> The translation here prefers ‘chaste persons’ over eunuchs or celibate persons for a number of reasons. First, the term eunuch is used figuratively by Christ, as is the term ‘castraverunt’ (castrated). Second, the term eunuch is obscure today. Third, this passage began with a teaching on the proper behavior of married persons, so it is not solely about virgins or celibate clergy and religious. The term ‘chaste persons’ has sufficient breadth and depth, and is an accurate representation of the meaning of the term.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-19-2' href='#cpdv-verse-19-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that Jesus specifically says ‘murder’ (homicidium), not ‘kill.’ Therefore, the Old Testament translation of the commandment as ‘You shall not murder’ is correct.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-19-3' href='#cpdv-verse-19-3'>c</a>. <span> It is often said, by the foolish, that the camel in this saying is literally a camel, and that the 'eye of a needle' is a particular gate into the city of Jerusalem. They claim that Jesus was only referring to getting a camel through that small gateway, when he expressed how hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God. But even though that gateway is narrow, it is not too difficult to get a camel through it. Perhaps it happened on a near daily basis. If this was the meaning of the saying, then it would not seem too difficult for the wealthy to enter heaven, and the disciples would be foolish to say 'Then who will be able to be saved?' And again, if so, then Jesus would not have said that it was impossible for men. So the saying has another meaning. It is a literal expression of the miraculous power of God. For a wealthy person to be saved, apart from the infinite mercy of God is impossible, nearly as impossible as literally passing a camel through the eye of a needle. But both acts can be done by the power of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1016-26-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1017-26-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And they took counsel so that by deceitfulness they might take hold of Jesus and kill him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1019-26-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1020-26-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>a woman drew near to him, holding an alabaster box of precious ointment, and she poured it over his head while he was reclining at table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1021-26-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But the disciples, seeing this, were indignant, saying: “What is the purpose of this waste?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1022-26-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For this could have been sold for a great deal, so as to be given to the poor.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1023-26-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But Jesus, knowing this, said to them: “Why are you bothering this woman? For she has done a good deed to me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1029-26-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And from then on, he sought an opportunity to betray him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1030-26-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then, on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples approached Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1040-26-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Now while they were eating the meal, Jesus took bread, and he blessed and broke and gave it to his disciples, and he said: “Take and eat. This is my body.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1041-26-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And taking the chalice, he gave thanks. And he gave it to them, saying: “Drink from this, all of you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1044-26-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And after a hymn was sung, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1045-26-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to them: “You will all fall away from me in this night. For it has been written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1047-26-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then Peter responded by saying to him, “Even if everyone else has fallen away from you, I will never fall away.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1048-26-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus said to him, “Amen I say to you, that in this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1050-26-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then Jesus went with them to a garden, which is called Gethsemani. And he said to his disciples, “Sit down here, while I go there and pray.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1051-26-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and saddened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1052-26-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then he said to them: “My soul is sorrowful, even unto death. Stay here and keep vigil with me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1053-26-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And continuing on a little further, he fell prostrate on his face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this chalice pass away from me.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1054-26-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And he approached his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter: “So, were you not able to keep vigil with me for one hour?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1056-26-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Again, a second time, he went and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this chalice cannot pass away, unless I drink it, let your will be done.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1057-26-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And again, he went and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1058-26-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And leaving them behind, again he went and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1059-26-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Then he approached his disciples and said to them: “Sleep now and rest. Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1060-26-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Rise up; let us go. Behold, he who will betray me draws near.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1064-26-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And Jesus said to him, “Friend, for what purpose have you come?” Then they approached, and they put their hands on Jesus, and they held him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1065-26-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And behold, one of those who were with Jesus, extending his hand, drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1066-26-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to him: “Put your sword back in its place. For all who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1068-26-54'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must be so?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1069-26-55'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>In that same hour, Jesus said to the crowds: “You went out, as if to a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1076-26-62'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>And the high priest, rising up, said to him, “Have you nothing to respond to what these ones testify against you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1077-26-63'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I bind you by an oath to the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1078-26-64'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>Jesus said to him: “You have said it. Yet truly I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1079-26-65'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then the high priest tore his garments, saying: “He has blasphemed. Why do we still need witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy.</span></div>

This period of time is similar to the time after sunset, when it is not yet dark. The length of this time is approximately an hour. Although the word ‘evening’ is used very broadly today, it specifically refers to that period of time between sunset and darkness, or, as in this case, between darkness and sunrise. So the two Marys set out at evening, that is, at first light in the morning, but before sunrise. The translation avoids this confusion of terms by using morning, instead of evening.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-28-2' href='#cpdv-verse-28-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that Matthew, after the Crucifixion, begins to count Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, as the Sabbath. Whereas, elsewhere in his Gospel, he counts Saturday as the Sabbath. He also states that this day is the first (Christian) Sabbath.</span></div>
