<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow laborer,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and to Apphia, most beloved sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in your house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I give thanks to my God, always keeping remembrance of you in my prayers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>(for I am hearing of your charity and faith, which you have in the Lord Jesus and with all the saints)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>so that the participation of your faith may become evident by the recognition of every good work which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For I have found great joy and consolation in your charity, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Because of this, I have enough confidence in Christ Jesus to command you concerning certain things,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>but I beg you instead, for the sake of charity, since you are so much like Paul: an old man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I beg you, on behalf of my son, whom I have begotten in my chains, Onesimus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>In times past, he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to me and to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So I have sent him back to you. And may you receive him like my own heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I myself wanted to retain him with me, so that he might minister to me, on your behalf, while I am in the chains of the Gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But I was willing to do nothing without your counsel, so as not to make use of your good deed as if out of necessity, but only willingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So perhaps, then, he departed from you for a time, so that you might receive him again for eternity,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>no longer as a servant, but, in place of a servant, a most beloved brother, especially to me: but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, if you hold me to be a companion, receive him as you would me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But if he has harmed you in any way, or if he is in your debt, charge it to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I, Paul, have written this with my own hand: I will repay. And I need not tell you, that you are also in debt yourself, to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So it is, brother. May I delight with you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I have written to you, trusting in your obedience, knowing, too, that you will do even more than what I say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But also, at once, prepare a lodging for me. For I am hoping, through your prayers, to present myself to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Greet Epaphras, my fellow captive in Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my helpers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Onesimus was a slave (or indentured servant) who fled, was converted to Christianity by Paul and others, and who then was sent back to his master. His transition from a slave to a servant is a figure for the transition that a person makes who is freed from the slavery of sin, so as to become the servant of all in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The last phrase ‘in Domino’ was changed to ‘in Christo’ in accord with the 1590 Sixtus V edition of the Vulgate.</span></div>
