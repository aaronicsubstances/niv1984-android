<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Note about the numbering of the Psalms: The numbering of the Psalms used in the CPDV is the same as the numbering in the Sixtus V and Clement VIII Latin Vulgate, with a few minor changes. The more typical numbering seen in many other versions of the Bible in English is according to the Hebrew text.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Or, more loosely translated: “Blessed is the man who has not followed the advice of the impious, and has not stood in the street among sinners, and has not sat in the company of complainers.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The Douay-Rheims notes are particularly insightful on this verse: “Blessed [Note: [a] He is in the right way to eternal happiness. ] is the man, that hath [Note: [b] not consented to evil suggestions. ] not gone in the counsel of the impious, & hath [Note: [c] not continued in sin. ] not stood in the way of sinners, and hath [Note: [d] not finally persisted in wicked life. ] not sit in the chair of pestilence:”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Note that, in translating the Psalms, I have decided to choose accuracy and a more literal rendering, over a looser and more poetic phrasing of the text. The reason is that a looser translation, obscures some of the meaning.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The verb ‘resurgent’ could be translated as ‘prevail again’ or as ‘rise up again.’ The translation ‘the impious will not rise up again in the judgment’ is avoided because both the just and the unjust will rise again at the general resurrection on the day of judgment.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-1' href='#cpdv-verse-4-1'>a</a>. <span> Usually, ‘finem’ refers to the end or limit of something, but the root of the word is related to ‘findo,’ which means to divide into parts. Thus the word ‘finem’ typically means ‘the last part.’ But, in the context of the Psalms, which were in ancient times, as they are still today, sung or chanted, the phrase ‘in finem’ can mean ‘in parts.’ This expression refers to a song that is divided into different singing parts (e.g. a duet, or a song with parts for a chorus and parts for individuals), or to a poem that is divided into different speaking parts.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-2' href='#cpdv-verse-4-2'>b</a>. <span> However, there is a more meaningful translation of ‘in finem.’ The notes of the Douay-Rheims version interpret ‘in finem’ (‘unto the end’) to refer to the New Testament: ‘pertaining unto the new Testament.’ And the Wycliffe version translates ‘in finem’ as ‘for victories,’ i.e. pertaining to a successful end. Thus, ‘in finem’ in this translation is usually rendered as ‘unto the end,’ since this translation makes the most fulfilling meanings most accessible.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-3' href='#cpdv-verse-4-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘carminibus’ refers to a card for working with wool or flax. It is a card with many divisions or parts. In this context, ‘carminibus’ refers to the division of the psalm into verses. In ancient times, the Bible was not divided into verses. Perhaps the first application of this concept to the Bible was in the psalms, which had to be divided into verses, because it is poetry and because it is sung.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-17-2' href='#cpdv-verse-17-2'>b</a>. <span> In most cases, ‘in finem’ means ‘in the end.’ In this context, perhaps the alternate translation of ‘in parts,’ also works. God does not wait until the end to correct, but He corrects in parts or in steps.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-17-4' href='#cpdv-verse-17-4'>d</a>. <span> Notice that the phrase ‘viro iniquo’ is translated using the word ‘man,’ but the word ‘iniquo’ by itself would be translated without the word ‘man.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-17-5' href='#cpdv-verse-17-5'>e</a>. <span> The phrase ‘dicam psalmum’ can be translated as ‘I will recite a psalm,’ but such a translation would too weak for this context. The context is that of being vindicated and liberated from great harm, and of confessing to God among the nations of the world. Therefore, the phrase does not mean to merely recite a psalm, but to compose a psalm. (Composition in ancient times was probably most often done in spoken words, since most persons were illiterate and those who were literate did much less reading and writing than the average person today.)</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-17-6' href='#cpdv-verse-17-6'>f</a>. <span> The term ‘christo suo David’ refers to David, and the term ‘semini eius’ refers to Jesus Christ.

It is also a fitting psalm for the start of the day.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-21-2' href='#cpdv-verse-21-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘unicornium’ does not refer to the mythical horse with a single horn. It refers literally to some type of wild animal with one horn in ancient times. This animal is most likely some species that has since gone extinct. Some have speculated that it could refer to the rhinoceros of India (Rhinoceros unicornis), which has one horn, unlike its African cousin, which has two horns. It also has a figurative meaning. Notice that the first part of the verse refers to being saved by lions. It is not the case that the Israelites were largely afraid of being eaten by lions; rather, the lion is figurative for a king or for governmental authority. Save me from governmental authority gone astray. Likewise, save my humility from the horns of the single-horned beast. This beast could represent law enforcement and military bodies gone astray. Guns and tanks can be figuratively said to have a single horn, yet they shoot many horns (bullets, etc.) from their single horn. May I be humble in the face of law enforcement and military authorities gone astray.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-21-3' href='#cpdv-verse-21-3'>c</a>. <span> The single-horned beast can also be said to be a figure of the Antichrist’s kingdom. The figure of a horn is often used in the Old Testament to signify a leader of a kingdom. The Antichrist’s kingdom has a single horn, in the sense that he is one leader who will have dominion over nearly the whole world. And it has many horns, in that there are many other leaders who exercise authority under the Antichrist.</span></div>

The word ‘intellectus’ is nominative, so it is the subject. The name David, and other non-Latin names written in Latin, often do not change their ending, despite being in various cases in various sentences. The word ‘David’ in this sentence is genitive (the understanding of David, or, David’s understanding). The word ‘ipsi’ is dative (to himself), but in English we would express this idea not by saying ‘The understanding of David to himself,’ but by saying, ‘The understanding of David himself.’ In other words, this psalm is about David’s own understanding. It is a psalm that describes things from David’s point of view.</span></div>

The word ‘olera’ refers to vegetables or herbs for use in a kitchen; so, as a phrase, ‘olera herbarum’ refers to herb that are for use in cooking: ‘kitchen herbs.’ These last dry out and droop easily, because they are delicate plants (often grown indoors).</span></div>

But based on the meaning of the remainder of the sentence, other translators have translated the text as ‘borrow’ and ‘repay.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-3' href='#cpdv-verse-36-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘miseretur’ refers to showing mercy, or compassion, or pity for someone.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-4' href='#cpdv-verse-36-4'>d</a>. <span> The phrase ‘offspring of,’ or ‘sons of,’ is a figure of speech often used in the Old Testament. It does not literally mean that a child will perish if his parents sin. It means that if you sin continually, you are acting as if you were the offspring of sin. Thus, ‘semen impiorum peribit’ could be translated as ‘the offspring of impiety will perish.’ In another example, the ‘sons of adultery’ are not the biological sons of adulterers, but they are those who act as if they had adultery itself as a parent. This figure of speech is predicated on the idea that children learn most from their parents. If you commit adultery, it is as if your parents were adulterers, or as if your parent was adultery itself.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-5' href='#cpdv-verse-36-5'>e</a>. <span> The word ‘capias’ is in the Clementine Vulgate, but it’s translation is not found in the Wycliffe, Douay, or Challoner versions. The word ‘capias’ refers to the land that the just ‘seize’ when the sinners pass away.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-6' href='#cpdv-verse-36-6'>f</a>. <span> In this context, the word ‘reliquiae’ could be accurately translated as ‘bequests,’ or ‘bestowals,’ or ‘bequeathments,’ or ‘endowments,’ or ‘allotments.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-7' href='#cpdv-verse-36-7'>g</a>. <span> The word ‘interibunt’ literally means ‘they will go between.’ This was an expression used to refer to going between this life and the next, i.e. passing away or crossing over. People still sometimes say that someone has ‘passed between the veil of this life and the next.’</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-44-1' href='#cpdv-verse-44-1'>a</a>. <span> This verse refers to the Virgin Mary, into whose lips grace has been freely poured. She is blessed by God in eternity.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-44-2' href='#cpdv-verse-44-2'>b</a>. <span> But this subsequent verse now refers to Christ himself, for the word ‘potentissime’ is singular masculine. Also, the superlative expression ‘most powerful one’ is fitting only for God, so it must refer to Christ, not Mary. As does the next verse also.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-44-3' href='#cpdv-verse-44-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘consortibus’ has a fairly wide range of meaning in Latin. It can refer to siblings, to associates or co-workers, but it can also refer to those who are to inherit something, to siblings who are co-heirs. The verse has the meaning of someone being anointed, while others who are also anointed watch. It also has the meaning of someone who is an heir, standing among others who are co-heirs. But the one being anointed is an Anointed among anointed ones, an Heir among co-heirs, a Prince among princes, a King among kings.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-44-4' href='#cpdv-verse-44-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘gutta’ refers to a tree or plant resin that is aromatic. The translation ‘balsam’ is used because a balsam is any type of tree or plant resin, but typically one that is aromatic.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-44-5' href='#cpdv-verse-44-5'>e</a>. <span> The word ‘filiæ’ is clearly feminine plural: ‘And the daughters of Tyre.’ Tyre was a wealthy city due to its prosperous dye (Tyrian purple) and clothier industry in Biblical times. However, ‘divites’ is clearly masculine plural: ‘all the rich men of the people.’ Ordinarily, a translator ought to prefer to translate one noun with one noun, but English does not allow one to indicate gender, even with many words that refer to people, such as ‘the rich’ or ‘the wealthy.’ Since the first part of the verse is clearly referring to the women of wealthy Tyre, the last part is also specifically meant to indicate the successful wealthy men among the people (not merely any or all of the people. Keeping the gender references intact in this verse is essential to understanding its meaning.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-54-1' href='#cpdv-verse-54-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘pusillanimitate’ is actually two Latin words put together. The first refers to a very young animal, but is used to express the idea of weakness. The second word refers to the mind, or soul, or spirit. The effect of putting the two words together results in an expression of the idea of a weak soul or a weak mind. Thus, ‘pusillanimitate spiritus’ refers to a weak-minded soul. The last word, ‘tempestate,’ in this context, refers not to a literal wind-storm, but to a tempest of the mind and soul, i.e. to inner turmoil. It can also be taken to refer to a storm of words or of various kinds of opposition to truth and justice.</span></div>

Is not the one who wrote this psalm a composer of psalms? So then, his response would not be merely to recite a memorized psalm, but to compose one. Psalms were composed in ancient times, not so much by sitting down and writing, but by speaking the psalm first, and writing it later.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-88-1' href='#cpdv-verse-88-1'>a</a>. <span> The text literally means ‘in them,’ but ‘them’ refers to ‘the heavens.’ The translation of ‘there’ makes this reference clearer, since English does not generally refer to Heaven as ‘them.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-88-2' href='#cpdv-verse-88-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘consilio’ in Latin can refer to either a deliberative group (council) or to a process of deliberating and giving advice (counsel). But in translating the Latin into English, one must choose within that broad range of meaning. The Latin word has a broader range of meaning than English words that could be used to translate. In this case, the translation is ‘counsel’ because God is more glorified in the deliberations, decisions, and advice of those who are holy than he is glorified by meetings of councils.</span></div>

The word ‘commutation’ refers to changing one thing into another. The commutation that gives us Christ in the Eucharist is called trans-substantiation. The doctrine of trans-substantiation is true doctrine, but the terminology itself is superfluous. Another term could be used to describe the same truth.</span></div>

The translation could be ‘To this David,’ but then the word ‘this’ would not be of much use, except to indicate the case of the word ‘David,’ i.e. ‘To David,’ rather than ‘To this David.’ Another possible translation (a somewhat loose translation), would be to view ‘David’ as the subject: ‘David is for this,’ which can be rephrased in English as ‘This is for David.’</span></div>

The meaning here is that God’s only Son was begotten in eternity, before the Angels were created, before the Angels fell from grace, before Lucifer (the light-bearer) became Satan (the adversary). The phrase ‘ex utero’ does not mean ‘from the womb,’ but has more of the meaning of ‘from conception.’ The word ‘utero’ is often used in Latin to refer to the generative capability (the ability to bring about conception) of men and women. In this case, it refers to the generative capability of the Father to give rise to the Son by procession.</span></div>

A Latin word is very often translated, and properly so, by one particular English word. Then along comes a context in which that Latin word actually means something else. It should be translated in this other context by another English word. But it is a common translation mistake not to do so. In this verse, the statement ‘I have loved,’ is followed, not by the reason that I loved, but by the result of that choice. I do not choose to love because I think that God will answer my prayers, but rather when I choose to love, the result is that God will answer my prayers.</span></div>
