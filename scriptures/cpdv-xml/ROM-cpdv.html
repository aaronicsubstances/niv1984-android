<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>Romans 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called as an Apostle, separated for the Gospel of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>which he had promised beforehand, through his Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>about his Son, who was made for him from the offspring of David according to the flesh,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>the Son of God, who was predestined in virtue according to the Spirit of sanctification from the resurrection of the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>through whom we have received grace and Apostleship, for the sake of his name, for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>from whom you also have been called by Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>To all who are at Rome, the beloved of God, called as saints. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Certainly, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, first for all of you, because your faith is being announced throughout the entire world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit by the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I have kept a remembrance of you</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>always in my prayers, pleading that in some way, at some time, I may have a prosperous journey, within the will of God, to come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you a certain spiritual grace to strengthen you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>specifically, to be consoled together with you through that which is mutual: your faith and mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, (though I have been hindered even to the present time) so that I might obtain some fruit among you also, just as also among the other Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>To the Greeks and to the uncivilized, to the wise and to the foolish, I am in debt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So within me there is a prompting to evangelize to you also who are at Rome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation for all believers, the Jew first, and the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the justice of God is revealed within it, by faith unto faith, just as it was written: “For the just one lives by faith.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven over every impiety and injustice among those men who fend off the truth of God with injustice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is known about God is manifest in them. For God has manifested it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For unseen things about him have been made conspicuous, since the creation of the world, being understood by the things that were made; likewise his everlasting virtue and divinity, so much so that they have no excuse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For although they had known God, they did not glorify God, nor give thanks. Instead, they became weakened in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was obscured.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For, while proclaiming themselves to be wise, they became foolish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of four-legged beasts, and of serpents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For this reason, God handed them over to the desires of their own heart for impurity, so that they afflicted their own bodies with indignities among themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And they worshipped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is blessed for all eternity. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Because of this, God handed them over to shameful passions. For example, their females have exchanged the natural use of the body for a use which is against nature.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And similarly, the males also, abandoning the natural use of females, have burned in their desires for one another: males doing with males what is disgraceful, and receiving within themselves the recompense that necessarily results from their error.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And since they did not prove to have God by knowledge, God handed them over to a morally depraved way of thinking, so that they might do those things which are not fitting:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>having been completely filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, spite, gossiping;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>slanderous, hateful toward God, abusive, arrogant, self-exalting, devisers of evil, disobedient to parents,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>foolish, disorderly; without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And these, though they had known the justice of God, did not understand that those who act in such a manner are deserving of death, and not only those who do these things, but also those who consent to what is done.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The term ‘naturalem usum’ is a way of referring discreetly to natural sexual relations. The word ‘naturalem’ refers to what is natural, but it is also used to refer to the body, or even specifically to the genitals. The earlier reference to ‘shameful passions’ provides a context indicating that ‘naturalem’ does not merely refer to what is natural in general, but specifically to the natural use of the genitals, that is, to natural sexual intercourse.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this reason, O man, each one of you who judges is inexcusable. For by that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For we know that the judgment of God is in accord with truth against those who do such things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But, O man, when you judge those who do such things as you yourself also do, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and patience and forbearance? Do you not know that the kindness of God is calling you to repentance?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But in accord with your hard and impenitent heart, you store up wrath for yourself, unto the day of wrath and of revelation by the just judgment of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For he will render to each one according to his works:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>To those who, in accord with patient good works, seek glory and honor and incorruption, certainly, he will render eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But to those who are contentious and who do not acquiesce to the truth, but instead trust in iniquity, he will render wrath and indignation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that works evil: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But glory and honor and peace are for all who do what is good: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For there is no favoritism with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For whoever had sinned without the law, will perish without the law. And whoever had sinned in the law, will be judged by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but rather it is the doers of the law who shall be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature those things which are of the law, such persons, not having the law, are a law unto themselves.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if you are called by name a Jew, and you rest upon the law, and you find glory in God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and you have known his will, and you demonstrate the more useful things, having been instructed by the law:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>you become confident within yourself that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>As a result, you teach others, but you do not teach yourself. You preach that men should not steal, but you yourself steal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>You speak against adultery, but you commit adultery. You abominate idols, but you commit sacrilege.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Certainly, circumcision is beneficial, if you observe the law. But if you are a betrayer of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And so, if the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this lack of circumcision be counted as circumcision?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So then, what more is the Jew, or what is the usefulness of circumcision?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Much in every way: First of all, certainly, because the eloquence of God was entrusted to them.</span></div>
