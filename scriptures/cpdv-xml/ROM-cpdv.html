<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1'>Romans 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called as an Apostle, separated for the Gospel of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>which he had promised beforehand, through his Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>about his Son, who was made for him from the offspring of David according to the flesh,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>the Son of God, who was predestined in virtue according to the Spirit of sanctification from the resurrection of the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>through whom we have received grace and Apostleship, for the sake of his name, for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>from whom you also have been called by Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>To all who are at Rome, the beloved of God, called as saints. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Certainly, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, first for all of you, because your faith is being announced throughout the entire world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit by the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I have kept a remembrance of you</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>always in my prayers, pleading that in some way, at some time, I may have a prosperous journey, within the will of God, to come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you a certain spiritual grace to strengthen you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>specifically, to be consoled together with you through that which is mutual: your faith and mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, (though I have been hindered even to the present time) so that I might obtain some fruit among you also, just as also among the other Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>To the Greeks and to the uncivilized, to the wise and to the foolish, I am in debt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So within me there is a prompting to evangelize to you also who are at Rome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation for all believers, the Jew first, and the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the justice of God is revealed within it, by faith unto faith, just as it was written: “For the just one lives by faith.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven over every impiety and injustice among those men who fend off the truth of God with injustice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is known about God is manifest in them. For God has manifested it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For unseen things about him have been made conspicuous, since the creation of the world, being understood by the things that were made; likewise his everlasting virtue and divinity, so much so that they have no excuse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For although they had known God, they did not glorify God, nor give thanks. Instead, they became weakened in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was obscured.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For, while proclaiming themselves to be wise, they became foolish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of four-legged beasts, and of serpents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For this reason, God handed them over to the desires of their own heart for impurity, so that they afflicted their own bodies with indignities among themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And they worshipped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is blessed for all eternity. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Because of this, God handed them over to shameful passions. For example, their females have exchanged the natural use of the body for a use which is against nature.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And similarly, the males also, abandoning the natural use of females, have burned in their desires for one another: males doing with males what is disgraceful, and receiving within themselves the recompense that necessarily results from their error.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And since they did not prove to have God by knowledge, God handed them over to a morally depraved way of thinking, so that they might do those things which are not fitting:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>having been completely filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, spite, gossiping;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>slanderous, hateful toward God, abusive, arrogant, self-exalting, devisers of evil, disobedient to parents,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>foolish, disorderly; without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And these, though they had known the justice of God, did not understand that those who act in such a manner are deserving of death, and not only those who do these things, but also those who consent to what is done.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The term ‘naturalem usum’ is a way of referring discreetly to natural sexual relations. The word ‘naturalem’ refers to what is natural, but it is also used to refer to the body, or even specifically to the genitals. The earlier reference to ‘shameful passions’ provides a context indicating that ‘naturalem’ does not merely refer to what is natural in general, but specifically to the natural use of the genitals, that is, to natural sexual intercourse.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-36'>Romans 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this reason, O man, each one of you who judges is inexcusable. For by that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For we know that the judgment of God is in accord with truth against those who do such things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But, O man, when you judge those who do such things as you yourself also do, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and patience and forbearance? Do you not know that the kindness of God is calling you to repentance?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But in accord with your hard and impenitent heart, you store up wrath for yourself, unto the day of wrath and of revelation by the just judgment of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For he will render to each one according to his works:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>To those who, in accord with patient good works, seek glory and honor and incorruption, certainly, he will render eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But to those who are contentious and who do not acquiesce to the truth, but instead trust in iniquity, he will render wrath and indignation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that works evil: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But glory and honor and peace are for all who do what is good: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For there is no favoritism with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For whoever had sinned without the law, will perish without the law. And whoever had sinned in the law, will be judged by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but rather it is the doers of the law who shall be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature those things which are of the law, such persons, not having the law, are a law unto themselves.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For they reveal the work of the law written in their hearts, while their conscience renders testimony about them, and their thoughts within themselves also accuse or even defend them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>unto the day when God shall judge the hidden things of men, through Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if you are called by name a Jew, and you rest upon the law, and you find glory in God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and you have known his will, and you demonstrate the more useful things, having been instructed by the law:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>you become confident within yourself that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>an instructor to the foolish, a teacher to children, because you have a type of knowledge and truth in the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>As a result, you teach others, but you do not teach yourself. You preach that men should not steal, but you yourself steal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>You speak against adultery, but you commit adultery. You abominate idols, but you commit sacrilege.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>You would glory in the law, but through a betrayal of the law you dishonor God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>(For because of you the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles, just as it was written.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Certainly, circumcision is beneficial, if you observe the law. But if you are a betrayer of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And so, if the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this lack of circumcision be counted as circumcision?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And that which is by nature uncircumcised, if it fulfills the law, should it not judge you, who by the letter and by circumcision are a betrayer of the law?</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-2" id="cpdv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For a Jew is not he who seems so outwardly. Neither is circumcision that which seems so outwardly, in the flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>But a Jew is he who is so inwardly. And circumcision of the heart is in the spirit, not in the letter. For its praise is not of men, but of God.</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-69'>Romans 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So then, what more is the Jew, or what is the usefulness of circumcision?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Much in every way: First of all, certainly, because the eloquence of God was entrusted to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief nullify the faith of God? Let it not be so!</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-3-1" id="cpdv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For God is truthful, but every man is deceitful; just as it was written: “Therefore, you are justified in your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if even our injustice points to the justice of God, what shall we say? Could God be unfair for inflicting wrath?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>(I am speaking in human terms.) Let it not be so! Otherwise, how would God judge this world?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For if the truth of God has abounded, through my falseness, unto his glory, why should I still be judged as such a sinner?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And should we not do evil, so that good may result? For so we have been slandered, and so some have claimed we said; their condemnation is just.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>What is next? Should we try to excel ahead of them? By no means! For we have accused all Jews and Greeks to be under sin,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>just as it was written: “There is no one who is just.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>All have gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Grief and unhappiness are in their ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the way of peace they have not known.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But we know that whatever the law speaks, it speaks to those who are in the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the entire world may be subject to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For in his presence no flesh shall be justified by the works of the law. For knowledge of sin is through the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But now, without the law, the justice of God, to which the law and the prophets have testified, has been made manifest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the justice of God, through the faith of Jesus Christ, is in all those and over all those who believe in him. For there is no distinction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For all have sinned and all are in need of the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>We have been justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>whom God has offered as a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to reveal his justice for the remission of the former offenses,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So then, where is your self-exaltation? It is excluded. Through what law? That of works? No, but rather through the law of faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For we judge a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-103'>Romans 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So then, what shall we say that Abraham had achieved, who is our father according to the flesh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if Abraham was justified by works, he would have glory, but not with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For what does Scripture say? “Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But for he who works, wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to debt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Yet truly, for he who does not work, but who believes in him who justifies the impious, his faith is reputed unto justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Similarly, David also declares the blessedness of a man, to whom God brings justice without works:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>“Blessed are they whose iniquities have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Does this blessedness, then, remain only in the circumcised, or is it even in the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was reputed to Abraham unto justice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But then how was it reputed? In circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he received the sign of circumcision as a symbol of the justice of that faith which exists apart from circumcision, so that he might be the father of all those who believe while uncircumcised, so that it might also be reputed to them unto justice,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and he might be the father of circumcision, not only for those who are of circumcision, but even for those who follow the footsteps of that faith which is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For the Promise to Abraham, and to his posterity, that he would inherit the world, was not through the law, but through the justice of faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For if those who are of the law are the heirs, then faith becomes empty and the Promise is abolished.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Because of this, it is from faith according to grace that the Promise is ensured for all posterity, not only for those who are of the law, but also for those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all before God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>in whom he believed, who revives the dead and who calls those things that do not exist into existence. For it is written: “I have established you as the father of many nations.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he believed, with a hope beyond hope, so that he might become the father of many nations, according to what was said to him: “So shall your posterity be.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, having been justified by faith, let us be at peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For through him we also have access by faith to this grace, in which we stand firm, and to glory, in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And not only that, but we also find glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation exercises patience,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and patience leads to proving, yet truly proving leads to hope,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>but hope is not unfounded, because the love of God is poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Yet why did Christ, while we were still infirm, at the proper time, suffer death for the impious?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now someone might barely be willing to die for the sake of justice, for example, perhaps someone might dare to die for the sake of a good man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But God demonstrates his love for us in that, while we were yet sinners, at the proper time,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Christ died for us. Therefore, having been justified now by his blood, all the more so shall we be saved from wrath through him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For if we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, while we were still enemies, all the more so, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-141'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And not only that, but we also glory in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into this world, and through sin, death; so also death was transferred to all men, to all who have sinned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For even before the law, sin was in the world, but sin was not imputed while the law did not exist.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the sin through one is not entirely like the gift. For certainly, the judgment of one was unto condemnation, but the grace toward many offenses is unto justification.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For though, by the one offense, death reigned through one, yet so much more so shall those who receive an abundance of grace, both of the gift and of justice, reign in life through the one Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore, just as through the offense of one, all men fell under condemnation, so also through the justice of one, all men fall under justification unto life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For, just as through the disobedience of one man, many were established as sinners, so also through the obedience of one man, many shall be established as just.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now the law entered in such a way that offenses would abound. But where offenses were abundant, grace was superabundant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-152'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So then, just as sin has reigned unto death, so also may grace reign through justice unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-184'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For example, a woman who is subject to a husband is obligated by the law while her husband lives. But when her husband has died, she is released from the law of her husband.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-293'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>“Or who shall descend into the abyss?” (that is, to call back Christ from the dead).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-314'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>God has not driven away his people, whom he foreknew. And do you not know what Scripture says in Elijah, how he calls upon God against Israel?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For if their loss is for the reconciliation of the world, what could their return be for, except life out of death?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-329'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For if the first-fruit has been sanctified, so also has the whole. And if the root is holy, so also are the branches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-330'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And if some of the branches are broken, and if you, being a wild olive branch, are grafted on to them, and you become a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-331'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>do not glorify yourself above the branches. For though you glory, you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-336'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Moreover, if they do not remain in unbelief, they will be grafted on. For God is able to graft them on again.</span></div>
