<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a man from Bethlehem in Judah departed to sojourn in the region of the Moabites with his wife and two children.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Elimelech the husband of Naomi died; and she remained with her sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>They took wives from among the Moabites, of whom one was called Orpah, and the other Ruth. And they lived there ten years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they both died, namely Mahlon and Chilion, and the woman was left alone, bereaved of her two children and her husband.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And she arose so that she might journey to her native land, with both her daughters-in-law, from the region of the Moabites. For she had heard that the Lord had provided for his people and had given them food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so she departed from the place of her sojourn, with both her daughters-in-law, and having set out upon the way, she was about to return to the land of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>She said to them, “Go to the home of your mother. May the Lord deal mercifully with you, just as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands, whom you will obtain by lot.” And she kissed them. They lifted up their voice, and began to weep,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But she answered them, “Return, my daughters. Why come with me? Do I have any more sons in my womb, so that you could hope for husbands from me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Return, my daughters, go forth. For I am now exhausted by old age, and not fit for the bond of marriage. Even if I were to conceive on this night, and bear sons,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>if you were willing to wait until they were grown and had completed the years of adolescence, you would be elderly before you could marry. Do not do so, I beg you, my daughters. For your difficulties weigh upon me greatly, and the hand of the Lord has been set against me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In response, they lifted up their voice and began to weep again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, and then turned back. Ruth clung to her mother-in-law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Naomi said to her, “See, your kinswoman returns to her people, and to her gods. Hurry after her.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>She answered, “Do not be against me, as if I would abandon you and go away; for wherever you will go, I will go, and where you will stay, I also will stay with you. Your people are my people, and your God is my God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Whichever land will receive you dying, in the same I will die, and there I will have the place of my burial.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore, Naomi saw that Ruth, being firmly resolved in her soul, was determined to go with her, and that she was unwilling to be dissuaded, and that nothing further could convince her to return to her own.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And so they set out together, and they came to Bethlehem. When they had entered the city, the news quickly spread among them all. And the women said, “This is that Naomi.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But she said to them, “Do not call me Naomi (that is, beautiful), but call me Mara (that is, bitter). For the Almighty has greatly filled me with bitterness.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The usual word for children is pueri, but this word can also mean servants. So the word liberis is used, which means children, but which can also mean free (i.e., not in servitude).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The word sortiturae is hard to translate because it refers to the idea that one obtains something by chance or good fortune, but also under the Providence of God. The expression “obtain by lot” is metaphorical; women did not cast lots to obtain husbands. Notice that the word virorum or vir is used to mean husband. The word vir is related to the word virtus, meaning strength or virtue. Though the word vir is often used to mean man or husband, it is also somewhat complimentary in nature, since it is related to the word virtus. This is analogous to the English word gentleman; it refers to a man in a somewhat complimentary fashion. The word used to simply refer to a man without such a built-in compliment is homo (singular) or homines (plural).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The word vinculo literally means chain, as in the chain of marriage.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Or, the place of my grave. The things that she asks God to cause to happen to her, if she lets anything separate her from her mother-in-law are not specified by the author of this book. In the actual conversation, Ruth would not literally have said “these things,” but would have indicated what sort of bad things should come upon her if she fails to do as she said. This telling of the story of Ruth by the author leaves out this detail of the conversation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> Or, being obstinate in soul.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> The text in parentheses is probably not original to the Hebrew text, since the meaning of these Hebrew names would not need to be explained to those who could understand Hebrew.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> The barley is reaped in the springtime in Israel. Planting must occur in the autumn, because the only appreciable rainfall occurs in winter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen to me, daughter. Do not go to gather in any other field, nor depart from this place, but join with my young women,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and follow where they reap. For I have given orders to my young men, so that no one is to harass you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>May the Lord repay you for your work, and may you receive a full reward from the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you have come, and under whose wings you have taken refuge.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And then she arose from there, so as to gather the ears of grain, according to the custom. But Boaz commanded his servants, saying, “If she is even willing to reap with you, do not prevent her,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and purposely let fall some from your bundles, and allow them to remain, so that she may gather without blushing, and let no one rebuke her gathering.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so she gathered in the field until evening. And striking and threshing with a staff what she had gathered, she found about the measure of an ephah of barley, that is, three measures.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-5" id="cpdv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Carrying this, she returned into the city and showed it to her mother-in-law. Moreover, she offered it to her and even gave her the leftovers of her food, with which she had been satisfied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gathered today, and where have you found work?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Naomi answered her, “May he be blessed by the Lord, because the same kindness which he provided for the living, he also kept for the dead.” And again she said: “This man is our near relative.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And her mother-in-law said to her, “It is better, my daughter, to go out reaping with his young women, lest in a stranger’s field someone may confront you.”</span></div>

<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-8" id="cpdv-verse-2-8">h</a>]</sup></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-64'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> Naomi and Ruth had no husbands, no work (at first), and so they were in fairly dire straits. Their closest relative in the area was Boaz, someone they did not know well.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> The word puella means young woman, but there is also a connotation of servitude.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The word molestus means to trouble or to annoy, but there is also clearly a sexual implication, so the word could be translated as molest. But Boaz tells the young men not to harass her, or not to flirt with her. Certainly, Boaz, being a devout Jew, would not have permitted any of his workers to have sexual relations outside of marriage.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> The words ancillae and puellarum both refer to young women and both connote a role of some servitude, but ancillae has comparatively the greater degree of servitude.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> An ephah is a dry unit of measure approximately equal to three pecks or six gallons. A “measure” in ancient Rome was approximately equivalent to one peck or two gallons. Here again the text beginning with “that is” was probably added at a later date, for those who do not know the Hebrew language.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> In previous verses, other terms were used to indicate a relative, but here the word propinquus is used to indicate a particular type of relative, one who is near of kin, or next of kin. The significance is that Naomi and Ruth were hoping that their nearest male relative would give them assistance, and they also hoped that, if he were unmarried, he would fulfill an obligation under Jewish law and custom to take Ruth as his wife. Since Ruth was a foreigner, not of Jewish descent, this obligation would have been somewhat in doubt. Therefore, Naomi and Ruth do not approach him in an open and forthright manner.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-7' href='#cpdv-verse-2-7'>g</a>. <span> In a stranger’s field, someone might object to Ruth because she is a foreigner, or they might assault her.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-8' href='#cpdv-verse-2-8'>h</a>. <span> This time period would be at least several weeks, since their were two crops to harvest and the work was done by hand. The harvest in Israel is completed in the time between Passover and the Feast of Weeks.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> Naomi’s plan is not to approach Boaz openly to see if he would take Ruth as his wife, for Ruth was a foreigner. Also, Naomi had been away for many years so that she did not have a secure place in the social structure of the town. She and Ruth were treated somewhat as outsiders. And the women said, “This is that Naomi.” On the other hand, Naomi is not suggesting that Ruth approach Boaz for sexual relations. Rather, she suggests that Ruth approach Boaz when they can be alone, to see if he is interested in her and to let her know that she is interested in him. Naomi’s plan is somewhat inappropriate, yet God uses her flawed plan within His perfect Plan.</span></div>

<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-91'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-4-1" id="cpdv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>They settled down, and he spoke to the kinsman, “Naomi, who has returned from the region of the Moabites, is selling part of a field of our brother Elimelech.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I wanted you to hear this, and to tell you in front of everyone sitting here, including the eldest of my people. If you will take possession of it by the right of kinship, buy it and possess it. But if it displeases you, you should reveal this to me, so that I will know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides you, who is before me, and I am after you.” But he answered, “I will buy the field.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Boaz said to him, “When buying the field, you are likewise obliged to accept the hand of the woman Ruth, the Moabite, who was the wife of the deceased, so that you may raise up the name of your near kinsman through his posterity.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He answered, “I yield my right of kinship, for I am obliged not to cut off the posterity of my own family. You may make use of my privilege, which I freely declare I will forego.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Yet it was the custom between kinsmen in this former time in Israel, that if at any time one yielded his right to another, so as to confirm his permission, the man took off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor. This was a testimony of concession in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-97'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-4-2" id="cpdv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And so Boaz said to his kinsman, “Take off your shoe.” And immediately he released it from his foot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to the eldest and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day, that I have taken possession of all that belonged to Elimelech and Chilion and Mahlon, and was bequeathed to Naomi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Ruth, the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, I have taken in marriage so as to raise up the name of the deceased in his posterity, so that his name will not be cut off from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>All the people who were at the gate, along with the eldest, answered, “We are witnesses. May the Lord make this woman, who enters into your house, like Rachel, and Leah, who built up the house of Israel, so that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrathah, and so that her name may be honored in Bethlehem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring which the Lord will give to you from this young woman.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-103'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And so Boaz took Ruth, and received her as his wife, and he went in to her, and the Lord granted to her to conceive and bear a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not permitted your family to be without a successor, and may his name be called upon in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-105'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-4-3" id="cpdv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And now you may have someone to comfort your soul and to care for you in old age, for he is born of your daughter-in-law, who loves you, and this is much better for you, than if you had seven sons.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And taking up the boy, Naomi placed him on her bosom, and she took on the duties of carrying him and nursing him.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-108'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-4-4" id="cpdv-verse-4-4">d</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the women of the near future were congratulating her and saying, “There was a son born to Naomi. They called his name Obed. Here is the father of Jesse, the father of David.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>These are the generations of Perez: Perez conceived Hezron,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Amminadab conceived Nahshon, Nahshon conceived Salmon,</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-1' href='#cpdv-verse-4-1'>a</a>. <span> Boaz’s word carries weight with the people of this city, even the elders.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-2' href='#cpdv-verse-4-2'>b</a>. <span> This last sentence of explanation is needed either to explain, to the Jews of one time period, a practice no longer used in Israel, or to explain to the non-Hebrew the custom of the Jews. This text may have been a later addition to the book.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-3' href='#cpdv-verse-4-3'>c</a>. <span> These are the women contemporaneous with Ruth. They formerly treated her as an outsider, but now they accept her as one of their own.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-4' href='#cpdv-verse-4-4'>d</a>. <span> Naomi was not very old, despite her protests in Ruth 1:12, for she was still able to nurse this child. The word nutricis has a meaning more like nursing a child, and less like nursing a patient.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-4-5' href='#cpdv-verse-4-5'>e</a>. <span> The word vicinae means nearby and usually means nearby in place. However, in this context, the women nearby in place could not have known that Obed would grow up to be the father of Jesse, and he the father of David. Thus, the meaning is nearby in time, that is, the women of the near future.</span></div>
