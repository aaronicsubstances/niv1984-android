<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The cases of the words ‘patres vestros iracundia’ do not match the cases of the corresponding words in translation because English grammar expresses this meaning in a different way. In English, ‘of your fathers’ would seen to be a translation of the genitive case, but in Latin the fathers are the object of the verb referring to anger, so the case is accusative.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘legitima’ refers to ‘lawful authority’ or ‘lawfulness.’ Notice that in Latin, the word ‘numquid’ is used, making this verse a kind of rhetorical question. But the translation uses ‘indeed’ to indicate the same meaning, without forming a question, because a rhetorical question would not be fitting in the English of this verse.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The phrase ‘in profundo’ has the word ‘profundo’ as a nouns, referring to the abyss, or the depths, or the chasm. In other words, they were not on the earth, but were in an other-worldly place, waiting.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Notice that these are the same as the four horses in the Book of Revelation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The word ‘lord’ is not capitalized because the prophet was speaking to the Angel, and then he said to the Angel, ‘my lord.’ He was not addressing God directly.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> The 70th year, in the context of Daniel’s 490 years, is the year 2018 A.D. The sufferings of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse occur from 2010 through 2018. The year 2019 is the 2000th anniversary of the Crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ (A.D. 19). In that year, 2019, the sufferings of the four horsemen (namely, World War 3, civil disorder and violence, the famine, and death from a variety of causes) will begin to quiet down. Then, from A.D. 2019 to 2023, these particular sufferings will diminish and end.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> The four horns are the four kingdoms into which the great monarch’s kingdom (established in A.D. 2040) will be divided (after his kingdom, in the latter part of the 21st century). These four are less holy than the great monarch’s kingdom, and they begin a continual decrease in holiness and wisdom, and a continual increase in sin and deceit, that finally, hundreds of years later, results in the kingdom of the Antichrist (the horn lifted over Judah).</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> This verse refers to the division of the great monarch’s kingdom into four lesser kingdoms.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘eliget’ can mean ‘to choose’ or ‘to single out.’ If there are two fitting ways to translate a word, and if most translations choose the one, I will choose the other, so as to make more meaning and clarity available to the readers of the Bible.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> The prefix ‘con’ intensifies the verb in Latin; the prefix ‘a’ intensifies the verb in English; hence ‘consurrexit’ becomes ‘has arisen,’ rather than ‘has risen.’</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> All the horses were strong, not merely the speckled ones. The symbolism of the horses is that of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. The white horses represent a war, ordained by God, in which a vast territory is conquered (World War 3). The red horses represent civil disorder and violence during the war. The black horses represent a famine. The speckled (varii) horses represent death from a variety of causes. There are four of each type of horse representing the four directions, for these events affect the whole world.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> The speckled horses, representing death from a variety of causes, has a greater effect in the Southern Hemisphere. The War (white horses) and the Famine (black horses) have a greater effect in the Northern Hemisphere. The civil disorder and violence (red horses) have a great effect throughout the world.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-3' href='#cpdv-verse-6-3'>c</a>. <span> The red horses are the most strong and they roam throughout the whole earth. The red horses represent civil disorder and violence.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-4' href='#cpdv-verse-6-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘transmigratione’ could be translated as ‘transmigration,’ except that in English, the word captivity more clearly conveys the fact the Babylonian captivity was forced upon the Jews. The word ‘transmigration’ could be applied even to a voluntary movement of peoples.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-5' href='#cpdv-verse-6-5'>e</a>. <span> Or, ‘the East’ is his name. The sun rises in the East, so the word for rising and for East is the same. Since the rising of the sun in the East is a fact known to all, this correspondence between Rising and East is not merely a coincidence of the Latin language. The man named ‘the Rising’ or ‘the East’ is the one often called ‘the Angelic Shepherd.’ He is the Pope who is in office during the mid to late 2030’s (though his reign may begin earlier), and he has a long papacy lasting into the 2040’s and perhaps the 2050's.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-6' href='#cpdv-verse-6-6'>f</a>. <span> These two previous verses refer to the great monarch and the Angelic Shepherd, the great monarch rises to power under the guidance and after the Angelic Shepherd. The great monarch will build a Temple to the Lord, in Jerusalem, under the guidance of the Angelic Shepherd. The great monarch will sit on one throne and the Angelic Shepherd will sit on another (the throne of the papacy). And their will be peace and cooperation between them both:</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-7' href='#cpdv-verse-6-7'>g</a>. <span> “And you will speak to him, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying: Behold a man [the Angelic Shepherd], the Rising is his name. And under him [the Angelic Shepherd], he [the great monarch] will rise up, and he [the great monarch] will build a temple to the Lord.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-8' href='#cpdv-verse-6-8'>h</a>. <span> “And he [the great monarch] will raise a temple to the Lord. And he [the Angelic Shepherd] will carry the glory, and he [the great monarch] will sit and rule upon his throne. And he [the Angelic Shepherd] will be a priest upon his throne, and a counsel of peace will be between the two of them [the Angelic Shepherd & the great monarch].”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-9' href='#cpdv-verse-6-9'>i</a>. <span> Notice that in Latin, the second and third of these four names are feminine (ending in ‘æ’). These four names represent the four leaders who rule after the great monarch, when his vast kingdom is divided into four parts. Two of the names are feminine because two of the four leaders will be women, even though it is contrary to God’s will for women to have such positions of leadership in society. The fourth name is the man who will rule over the kingdom of the South (Israel, the Middle East, Northern Africa), which is the southern-most part of the great monarch’s kingdom. He will be the holiest of the four leaders; his kingship is a memorial to the Temple of the Lord. He is called the ‘son of Zephaniah,’ yet he is not the son of the great monarch. Rather, he is like the great monarch; he takes after him as a son takes after his father.</span></div>

Now perhaps the first staff was handsome or beautiful in soul. So, the two staffs represent the contemplative life and the active life among religious and clergy.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-2' href='#cpdv-verse-11-2'>b</a>. <span> Some texts have the coins being tossed into a treasury, some towards a statuary. The spiritual meaning of this word may refer, not only to the price Judas Iscariot was paid to betray Christ, but to some future taxation by the administrative powers within the Church. God is angry at this event, but He directs the faithful to pay the tax. The treasury is the treasury of the Church; the statuary represents those leaders in the Church who are like statures, mere administrators or bureaucrats, lacking insight and compassion. Compare this to the story in the Gospels of the tax that Peter paid by catching a fish with a coin in its mouth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-3' href='#cpdv-verse-11-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘germanitatem’ is feminine, so a translation of ‘sisterhood’ might be justifiable. However, Judah and Israel are two groups symbolically represented with the names of two men, so the translation is ‘brotherhood.’ Notice that the first staff was cut down, but the second was merely shortened.</span></div>

The separateness is also between different religions and denominations, for, at first, many people will seek refuge in their own religion. Later, Protestants will come to realize that they should unite with the Catholic Church. The separateness is a separateness of families that have been separated by distance, or by conflict.

The passage refers to men and women who have transgressed against God’s law and have become unclean or defiled. The implication of the passage is that men and women who have committed sexual sins can obtain absolution, a washing of the soul. The male transgresses by his sexual sins and the female become defiled by her sexual sins.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-1' href='#cpdv-verse-14-1'>a</a>. <span> The ‘Gentiles’ in the context of the Church today, refers to unbelievers, not to non-Jews. The ‘central part of the city’ could also be translated as ‘half of the city,’ (but half in the looser sense, not a literal one half).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-2' href='#cpdv-verse-14-2'>b</a>. <span> The ‘center’ could also be translated as ‘half.’ The ‘Meridian’ is often translated as ‘South,’ but this is a less accurate translation, because there is another word in Latin ‘Auster,’ that means ‘South.’ Words for direction, when used to refer to a region rather than a mere direction, are capitalized, e.g.: travel south for many days, and then you will enter the land of the South.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-3' href='#cpdv-verse-14-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘torcularia’ refers to a winepress or an oil press or a pressing room.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-4' href='#cpdv-verse-14-4'>d</a>. <span> Compare the verb ‘tabescet’ to the verb ‘contabescent;’ the latter has the prefix ‘con’ which intensifies the verb. Their flesh wastes away, but not completely. Their eyes and tongue completely waste away.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-5' href='#cpdv-verse-14-5'>e</a>. <span> The word ‘castris’ often has a military connotation, as in a military encampment. The ruin of beast of burden, in the modern context, probably refers to the ruin of machinery (the modern-day beasts of burden), including the machinery used by the military.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-6' href='#cpdv-verse-14-6'>f</a>. <span> The word ‘lebetes’ refers to a kettle or a cooking pot or a sink or a wash basin. Clearly, this word refers to common vessels, not to holy containers used on an altar. Yet even these will be considered holy.</span></div>
