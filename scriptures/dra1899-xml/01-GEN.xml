    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.</content>

      <content>The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.</content>

      <content>Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.</content>

      <content>And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.</content>

      <content>And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?</content>

      <content>And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</content>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.</content>

      <content>And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.</content>

      <content>And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Other seven also came up out of the river, ill favoured, and leanfleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao awaked after his rest:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Forthwith at the king&#8217;s command, Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him, and changing his apparel, brought him in to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And seven kine came up out of the river exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And they devoured and consumed the former,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew upon one stalk, full and very fair.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stock:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Joseph answered: The king&#8217;s dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Which shall be fulfilled in this order:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up under Pharao&#8217;s hands, and be reserved in the cities.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue, The saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao) and he went round all the countries of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis bore unto him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father&#8217;s house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="52">
      <content>And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been in Egypt were past:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="54">
      <content>The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="55">
      <content>And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharao for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="56">
      <content>And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="57">
      <content>And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.</content>

      <content>He saith: This is it that I said: You are spies.</content>

      <content>And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.</content>

      <content>And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And in the mouth of the younger&#8217;s sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.</content>

      <content>And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord&#8217;s house, gold or silver?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin&#8217;s sack.</content>

      <content>Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.</content>

      <content>And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place,) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground.</content>

      <content>And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.</content>

      <content>And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Joseph answered: God forbid that I should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art.</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man&#8217;s face.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two.</content>

      <content>One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and hitherto he appeareth not.</content>

      <content>If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</content>

      <content>Then Joseph said to the people: Behold as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao: take seed and sow the fields,</content>

      <content>And they answered: Our life is in thy hand: only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.</content>
