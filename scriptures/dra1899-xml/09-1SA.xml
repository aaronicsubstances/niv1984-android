    <verse num="1">
      <content>There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave to Phenenna his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had shut up her womb:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And thus she did every year, when the time returned that they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her: but Anna wept, and did not eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then Elcana her husband said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And Heli the priest sitting upon a stool before the door of the temple of the Lord:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And she made a vow, saying: O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a man child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And said to her: How long wilt thou be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: And the Lord remembered her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And Elcana her husband went up, and all his house, to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And Elcana her husband said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word. So the woman stayed at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt to day according to the custom, and then take as much as thy soul desireth. But he answered and said to him: Not so: but thou shalt give it me now, or else I will take it by force.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a linen ephod.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to offer the solemn sacrifice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The Lord give thee seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent to the Lord. And they went to their own home.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Now Heli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel: and how they lay with the women that waited at the door of the tabernacle:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And he said to them: Why do ye these kinds of things, which I hear, very wicked things, from all the people?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Do not so, my sons: for it is no good report that I hear, that you make the people of the Lord to transgress.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>If one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased in his behalf: but if a man shall sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him? And they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased both the Lord and men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear to thy father&#8217;s house, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, and burn incense to me, and to wear the ephod before me: and I gave to thy father&#8217;s house of all the sacrifices of the children of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me: but whosoever shall glorify me, him will I glorify: but they that despise me, shall be despised.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Behold the days come: and I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father&#8217;s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And thou shalt see thy rival in the temple, in all the prosperity of Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>However I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die when they come to man&#8217;s estate.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees: In one day they shall both of them die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house, shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli, and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no manifest vision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place, and his eyes were grown dim, that he could not see:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Before the lamp of God went out, Samuel slept in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And the Lord called Samuel. And he answered: Here am I.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And he ran to Heli and said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went and slept.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He answered: I did not call thee, my son: return and sleep.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the word of the Lord been revealed to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose up and went to Heli,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child, and he said to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and slept in his place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And the Lord came and stood: and he called, as he had called the other times: Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the Lord said to Samuel: Behold I do a thing in Israel: and whosoever shall hear it, both his ears shall tingle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>In that day I will raise up against Heli all the things I have spoken concerning his house: I will begin, and I will make an end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For I have foretold unto him, that I will judge his house for ever, for iniquity, because he knew that his sons did wickedly, and did not chastise them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Therefore have I sworn to the house of Heli, that the iniquity of his house shall not be expiated with victims nor offerings for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And Samuel slept till morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to tell the vision to Heli.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Then Heli called Samuel, and said: Samuel, my son. And he answered: Here am I.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he asked him: What is the word that the Lord hath spoken to thee? I beseech thee hide it not from me. May God do so and so to thee, and add so and so, if thou hide from me one word of all that were said to thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>So Samuel told him all the words, and did not hide them from him. And he answered: It is the Lord: let him do what is good in his sight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and not one of his words fell to the ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And all Israel from Dan to Bersabee, knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight: and Israel went out to war against the Philistines, and camped by the Stone of help. And the Philistines came to Aphec,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And put their army in array against Israel. And when they had joined battle, Israel turned their backs to the Philistines, and there were slain in that fight here and there in the fields about four thousand men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of Israel said: Why hath the Lord defeated us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts sitting upon the cherubims: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with the ark of the covenant of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, and the earth rang again.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the Philistines were afraid, saying: God is come into the camp. And sighing, they said:</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday and the day before: Woe to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high gods? these are the Gods that struck Egypt with all the plagues in the desert.</content>

      <content>And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over against the way watching. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And when the man was come into the city, he told it: and all the city cried out.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>And Heli heard the noise of the cry, and he said: What meaneth the noise of this uproar? But he made haste, and came, and told Heli.</content>

      <content>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have reckoned up all that Amalec hath done to Israel: how he opposed them in the way when they came up out of Egypt.</content>

      <content>Now therefore go, and smite Amalec, and utterly destroy all that he hath: spare him not, nor covet any thing that is his: but slay both man and woman, child and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</content>
