<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes, he was not warm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>His servants therefore said to him: Let us seek for our lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom, and warm our lord the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the coasts of Israel, and they found Abisag a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the damsel was exceeding beautiful, and she slept with the king: and served him, but the king did not know her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Adonias the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he conferred with Joab the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar the priest, who furthered Adonias’s side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David’s army was not with Adonias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Juda, the king’s servants:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But Nathan the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Nathan said to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Haggith reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now then come, take my counsel and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord O king, swear to me thy handmaid, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber: now the king was very old, and Abisag the Sunamitess ministered to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>She answered and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid by the Lord thy God, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And behold now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the king’s sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the general of the army: but Solomon thy servant he invited not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And now, my lord O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they told the king, saying: Nathan the prophet is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Nathan said: My lord O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king’s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But me thy servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Solomon thy servant he hath not invited.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And king David answered and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The king swore and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Even as I swore to thee by the Lord the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And Bethsabee bowing with her face to the earth worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>King David also said: Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And let Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And Banaias the son of Joiada answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the Lord the God of my lord the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>So Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet went down, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Sadoc the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: God save king Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end: Joab also hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>While he yet spoke, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord king David hath appointed Solomon king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And hath sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king’s mule.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-47-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Moreover Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-48-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And the king’s servants going in have blessed our lord king David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-49-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And he said: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-50-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose and every man went his way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-51-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose, and went, and took hold on the horn of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias, fearing king Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-53-1-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-54-1-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-57-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son Solomon, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-60-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-61-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Sarvia hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-74-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-76-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee, do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother, ask: for I must not turn away thy face.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-79-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-83-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Silo.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-84-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord and laid hold on the horn of the altar.</span></div>
