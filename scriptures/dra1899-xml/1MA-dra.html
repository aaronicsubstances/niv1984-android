<h2 id='dra-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it came to pass, after that Alexander the son of Philip the Macedonian, who first reigned in Greece, coming out of the land of Cethim, had overthrown Darius king of the Persians and Medes:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He fought many battles, and took the strong holds of all, and slew the kings of the earth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And he went through even to the ends of the earth, and took the spoils of many nations: and the earth was quiet before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he gathered a power, and a very strong army: and his heart was exalted and lifted up:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he subdued countries of nations, and princes; and they became tributaries to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And after these things, he fell down upon his bed, and knew that he should die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he called his servants the nobles that were brought up with him from his youth: and he divided his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Alexander reigned twelve years and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And his servants made themselves kings every one in his place:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And they all put crowns upon themselves after his death, and their sons after them many years, and evils were multiplied in the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And there came out of them a wicked root, Antiochus the Illustrious, the son of king Antiochus, who had been a hostage at Rome: and he reigned in the hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In those days there went out of Israel wicked men, and they persuaded many, saying: Let us go, and make a covenant with the heathens that are round about us: for since we departed from them, many evils have befallen us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the word seemed good in their eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And some of the people determined to do this, and went to the king: and he gave them license to do after the ordinances of the heathens.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they built a place of exercise in Jerusalem, according to the laws of the nations:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they made themselves prepuces, and departed from the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathens, and were sold to do evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the kingdom was established before Antiochus, and he had a mind to reign over the land of Egypt, that he might reign over two kingdoms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots and elephants, and horsemen, and a great number of ships:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And he made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt, but Ptolemee was afraid at his presence, and fled, and many were wounded unto death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he took the strong cities in the land of Egypt: and he took the spoils of the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And after Antiochus had ravaged Egypt in the hundred and forty-third year, he returned and went up against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he went up to Jerusalem with a great multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he proudly entered into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition, and the pouring vessels, and the vials, and the little mortars of gold, and the veil, and the crowns, and the golden ornament that was before the temple: and he broke them all in pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And he took the silver and gold, and the precious vessels: and he took the hidden treasures which he found: and when he had taken all away he departed into his own country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he made a great slaughter of men, and spoke very proudly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And there was great mourning in Israel, and in every place where they were:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And the princes, and the ancients mourned, and the virgins and the young men were made feeble, and the beauty of the women was changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Every bridegroom took up lamentation: and the bride that sat in the marriage bed, mourned:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And the land was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered with confusion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And after two full years the king sent the chief collector of his tributes to the cities of Juda, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And he spoke to them peaceable words in deceit: and they believed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And he fell upon the city suddenly, and struck it with a great slaughter, and destroyed much people in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And he took the spoils of the city, and burnt it with fire, and threw down the houses thereof, and the walls thereof round about:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And they took the women captive, and the children, and the cattle they possessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with strong towers, and made it a fortress for them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And they placed there a sinful nation, wicked men, and they fortified themselves therein: and they stored up armour, and victuals, and gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And laid them up there: and they became a great snare.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And this was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil devil in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And they shed innocent blood round about the sanctuary, and defiled the holy place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled away by reason of them, and the city was made the habitation of strangers, and she became a stranger to her own seed, and her children forsook her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Her sanctuary was desolate like a wilderness, her festival days were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach, her honours were brought to nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Her dishonour was increased according to her glory, and her excellency was turned into mourning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And king Antiochus wrote to all his kingdom, that all the people should be one: and every one should leave his own law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And all nations consented according to the word of king Antiochus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And many of Israel consented to his service, and they sacrificed to idols, and profaned the sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-47-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And the king sent letters by the hands of messengers to Jerusalem, and to all the cities of Juda: that they should follow the law of the nations of the earth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-48-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And should forbid holocausts and sacrifices, and atonements to be made in the temple of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-49-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And should prohibit the sabbath, and the festival days, to be celebrated.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-50-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>And he commanded the holy places to be profaned, and the holy people of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-51-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And he commanded altars to be built, and temples, and idols, and swine’s flesh to be immolated, and unclean beasts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And that they should leave their children uncircumcised, and let their souls be defiled with all uncleannesses, and abominations, to the end that they should forget the law, and should change all the justifications of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-53-1-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And that whosoever would not do according to the word of king Antiochus should be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-54-1-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>According to all these words he wrote to his whole kingdom, and he appointed rulers over the people that should force them to do these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-55-1-54'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>And they commanded the cities of Juda to sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-56-1-55'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>Then many of the people were gathered to them that had forsaken the law of the Lord: and they committed evils in the land:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-57-1-56'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>And they drove away the people of Israel into lurking holes, and into the secret places of fugitives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-58-1-57'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>On the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred and forty-fifth year, king Antiochus set up the abominable idol of desolation upon the altar of God, and they built altars throughout all the cities of Juda round about:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-59-1-58'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>And they burnt incense, and sacrificed at the doors of the houses, and in the streets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-60-1-59'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>And they cut in pieces, and burnt with fire the books of the law of God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-61-1-60'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>And every one with whom the books of the testament of the Lord were found, and whosoever observed the law of the Lord, they put to death, according to the edict of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-62-1-61'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>Thus by their power did they deal with the people of Israel, that were found in the cities month after month.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-63-1-62'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>And on the five and twentieth day of the month they sacrificed upon the altar of the idol that was over against the altar of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-64-1-63'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>Now the women that circumcised their children, were slain according to the commandment of king Antiochus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-65-1-64'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>And they hanged the children about their necks in all their houses: and those that had circumcised them, they put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-66-1-65'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>And many of the people of Israel determined with themselves, that they would not eat unclean things: and they chose rather to die than to be defiled with unclean meats.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-67-1-66'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>And they would not break the holy law of God, and they were put to death:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-68-1-67'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>And there was very great wrath upon the people.</span></div>

<h2 id='dra-bookmark-70-2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-71-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In those days arose Mathathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and he abode in the mountain of Modin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-72-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he had five sons: John who was surnamed Gaddis:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-73-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Simon, who was surnamed Thasi:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-74-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Judas, who was called Machabeus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-75-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Eleazar, who was surnamed Abaron: and Jonathan, who was surnamed Apphus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-76-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>These saw the evils that were done in the people of Juda, and in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-77-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Mathathias said: Woe is me, wherefore was I born to see the ruin of my people, and the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it is given into the hands of the enemies?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-78-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The holy places are come into the hands of strangers: her temple is become as a man without honour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-79-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The vessels of her glory are carried away captive: her old men are murdered in the streets, and her young men are fallen by the sword of the enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-80-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>What nation hath not inherited her kingdom, and gotten of her spoils?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-81-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>All her ornaments are taken away. She that was free is made a slave.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-82-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And behold our sanctuary, and our beauty, and our glory is laid waste, and the Gentiles have defiled them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-83-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>To what end then should we live any longer?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-84-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Mathathias and his sons rent their garments, and they covered themselves with haircloth, and made great lamentation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-85-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they that were sent from king Antiochus came thither, to compel them that were fled into the city of Modin, to sacrifice, and to burn incense, and to depart from the law of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-86-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And many of the people of Israel consented, and came to them: but Mathathias and his sons stood firm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-87-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And they that were sent from Antiochus, answering, said to Mathathias: Thou art a ruler, and an honourable, and great man in this city, and adorned with sons, and brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-88-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore come thou first, and obey the king’s commandment, as all nations have done, and the men of Juda, and they that remain in Jerusalem: and thou, and thy sons, shall be in the number of the king’s friends, and enriched with gold, and silver, and many presents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-89-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Mathathias answered, and said with a loud voice: Although all nations obey king Antiochus, so as to depart every man from the service of the law of his fathers, and consent to his commandments:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-90-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I and my sons, and my brethren will obey the law of our fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-91-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>God be merciful unto us: it is not profitable for us to forsake the law, and the justices of God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-92-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus, neither will we sacrifice, and transgress the commandments of our law, to go another way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-93-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now as he left off speaking these words, there came a certain Jew in the sight of all to sacrifice to the idols upon the altar in the city of Modin, according to the king’s commandment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-94-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Mathathias saw and was grieved and his reins trembled, and his wrath was kindled according to the judgment of the law, and running upon him he slew him upon the altar:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-95-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Moreover the man whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them to sacrifice, he slew at the same time, and pulled down the altar,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-96-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And shewed zeal for the law, as Phinees did by Zamri the son of Salomi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-97-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Mathathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: Every one that hath zeal for the law, and maintaineth the testament, let him follow me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-98-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So he, and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-99-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then many that sought after judgment, and justice, went down into the desert:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-100-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And they abode there, they and their children, and their wives, and their cattle: because afflictions increased upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-101-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And it was told to the king’s men, and to the army that was in Jerusalem in the city of David, that certain men who had broken the king’s commandment, were gone away into the secret places in the wilderness, and that many were gone after them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-102-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And forthwith they went out towards them, and made war against them on the sabbath day,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-103-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And they said to them: Do you still resist? come forth, and do according to the edict of king Antiochus, and you shall live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-104-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And they said: We will not come forth, neither will we obey the king’s edict, to profane the sabbath day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-105-2-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And they made haste to give them battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-106-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>But they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them, nor stopped up the secret places,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-107-2-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Saying: Let us all die in our innocency: and heaven and earth shall be witnesses for us, that you put us to death wrongfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-108-2-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>So they gave them battle on the sabbath: and they were slain with their wives, and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand persons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-109-2-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Mathathias and his friends heard of it, and they mourned for them exceedingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-110-2-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And every man said to his neighbour: If we shall all do as our brethren have done, and not fight against the heathens for our lives, and our justifications: they will now quickly root us out of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-111-2-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up against us to fight on the sabbath day, we will fight against him: and we will not all die, as our brethren that were slain in the secret places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-112-2-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Then was assembled to them the congregation of the Assideans, the stoutest of Israel, every one that had a good will for the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-113-2-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And all they that fled from the evils, joined themselves to them, and were a support to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-114-2-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And they gathered an army, and slew the sinners in their wrath, and the wicked men in their indignation: and the rest fled to the nations for safety.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-115-2-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And Mathathias and his friends went round about, and they threw down the altars:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-116-2-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And they circumcised all the children whom they found in the confines of Israel that were uncircumcised: and they did valiantly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-117-2-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And they pursued after the children of pride, and the work prospered in their hands:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-618-10-55'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>And king Ptolemee answered, saying: Happy is the day wherein thou didst return to the land of thy fathers, and sattest in the throne of their kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-619-10-56'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>And now I will do to thee as thou hast written: but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another, and I may give her to thee as thou hast said.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-638-10-75'><span class='verse-num'>[75]</span> <span>And they pitched their tents near Joppe, but they shut him out of the city: because a garrison of Apollonius was in Joppe, and he laid siege to it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-642-10-79'><span class='verse-num'>[79]</span> <span>And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen behind them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-644-10-81'><span class='verse-num'>[81]</span> <span>But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so their horses were fatigued.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-645-10-82'><span class='verse-num'>[82]</span> <span>Then Simon drew forth his army, and attacked the legion: for the horsemen were wearied: and they were discomfited by him, and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-646-10-83'><span class='verse-num'>[83]</span> <span>And they that were scattered about the plain, fled into Azotus, and went into Bethdagon their idol’s temple, there to save themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-647-10-84'><span class='verse-num'>[84]</span> <span>But Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and the cities that were round about it, and took the spoils of them, and the temple of Dagon: and all them that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.</span></div>
