    <verse num="1">
      <content>Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that, which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.</content>

      <content>Therefore he that speaketh unjust things cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Keep yourselves therefore from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For justice is perpetual and immortal.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But the wicked with works and words have called it to them: and esteeming it a friend have fallen away, and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.</content>

    <verse num="2">

    <verse num="9">
      <content>For the just children of good men were offering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of justice: that the just should receive both good and evil alike, singing now the praises of the fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them; for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Thy almighty word leapt down from heaven from thy royal throne, as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death, and standing on the earth reached even to heaven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And one thrown here, another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.</content>

      <content>For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things, lest they should perish and not know why they suffered these evils.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For a blameless man made haste to pray for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the oaths and covenant made with the fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones the glory of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.</content>

    <verse num="26">
      <content>And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.</content>

      <content>But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what they would do:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For when they had given them leave to depart, and had sent them away with great care, they repented, and pursued after them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this end: and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they might find a new death.</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>For every creature according to its kind was fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might be kept without hurt.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>For a cloud overshadowed their camp, and where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way without hinderance, and out of the great deep a springing field:</content>

      <content>Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy hand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in the time of their sojourning, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led by their appetite they asked for delicate meats.</content>

    <verse num="12">
      <content>For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the sea: and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse: for the others against their will received the strangers.</content>

      <content>For while the elements are changed in themselves, as in an instrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet all keep their sound: which may clearly be perceived by the very sight.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>For the things of the land were turned into things of the water: and the things before swam in the water passed upon the land.</content>

      <content>On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of corruptible animals walking therein, neither did they melt that good food, which was apt to melt as ice.
