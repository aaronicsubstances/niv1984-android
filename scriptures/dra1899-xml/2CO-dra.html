<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me; but in part, that I may not burden you all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-34-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-35-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-46-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-47-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-48-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-49-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-50-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-51-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-53-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-54-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-55-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-56-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-57-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-58-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-59-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-60-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-61-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-62-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-63-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-67-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience, in the sight of God.</span></div>
