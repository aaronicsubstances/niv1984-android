<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To Timothy my dearly beloved son, grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that without ceasing, I have a remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am certain that in thee also.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For which cause I admonish thee, that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee, by the imposition of my hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power, and of love, and of sobriety.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but labour with the gospel, according to the power of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath destroyed death, and hath brought to light life and incorruption by the gospel:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Wherein I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and teacher of the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For which cause I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed. For I know whom I have believed, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Hold the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me in faith, and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost, who dwelleth in us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia, are turned away from me: of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: because he hath often refreshed me, and hath not been ashamed of my chain:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But when he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me, and found me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well knowest.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others also.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The husbandman, that laboureth, must first partake of the fruits.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer; but the word of God is not bound.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he can not deny himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Know also this, that, in the last days, shall come dangerous times.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasures more than of God:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been committed to thee: knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can instruct thee to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming, and his kingdom:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</span></div>
