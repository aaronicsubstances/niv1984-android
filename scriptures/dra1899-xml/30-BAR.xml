      <content>For the sins that you have committed before God, you shall be carried away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon.</content>

      <content>And when you are come into Babylon, you shall be there many years, and for a long time, even to seven generations: and after that I will bring you away from thence with peace.</content>

      <content>But now, you shall see in Babylon gods of gold, and of silver, and of stone, and of wood borne upon shoulders, causing fear to the Gentiles.</content>

      <content>Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, and be afraid, and the fear of them should seize upon you.</content>

      <content>Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power: or else a profitable vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied: or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such false gods.</content>

      <content>By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them, you shall know that they are not gods. And they themselves at last are consumed, and shall be a reproach in the country.</content>
