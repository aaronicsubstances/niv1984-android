    <verse num="2">
      <content>To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place of theirs and ours.</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

      <content>I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

      <content>Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius;</content>

      <content>Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>That no flesh should glory in his sight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For I judged not myself to know any thing among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But to us God hath revealed them, by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.</content>

      <content>I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.</content>

      <content>For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man?</content>

      <content>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</content>
