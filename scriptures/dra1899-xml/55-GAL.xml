      <content>Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</content>

      <content>To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews&#8217; religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And I made progress in the Jews&#8217; religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother&#8217;s womb, and called me by his grace,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</content>

    <verse num="21">
      <content>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:</content>

      <content>And they glorified God in me.</content>

      <content>Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And I went up according to revelation; and communicated to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles sinners.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.</content>

    <verse num="12">
      <content>But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.</content>

      <content>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man&#8217;s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</content>

      <content>But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.</content>

      <content>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?</content>

      <content>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman,and the other by a free woman.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</content>
