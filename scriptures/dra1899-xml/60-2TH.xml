      <content>We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you towards each other, aboundeth:</content>

      <content>And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>That you be not easily moved from your sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.</content>
    </verse>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish; because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit, and faith of the truth:</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

      <content>For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of God may run, and may be glorified, even as among you;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men; for all men have not faith.</content>

      <content>And we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the tradition which they have received of us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Neither did we eat any man&#8217;s bread for nothing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For also when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Yet do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</content>

      <content>Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. The Lord be with you all.</content>
