<h2 id='dra-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and to teach,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Until the day on which, giving commandments by the Holy Ghost to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many proofs, for forty days appearing to them, and speaking of the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>They therefore who were come together, asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But he said to them: It is not for you to know the time or moments, which the Father hath put in his own power:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the uttermost part of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was raised up: and a cloud received him out of their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And while they were beholding him going up to heaven, behold two men stood by them in white garments.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Who also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him going into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet, which is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath day’s journey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren, said: (now the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty:)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the leader of them that apprehended Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity, and being hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all his bowels gushed out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so that the same field was called in their tongue, Haceldama; that is to say, The field of blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let their habitation become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein. And his bishopric let another take.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Wherefore of these men who have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas hath by transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-34-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-35-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and with your ears receive my words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-45-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-46-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-47-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-48-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-49-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-50-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And it shalt come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-51-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-53-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-54-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-55-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-56-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-57-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-58-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David; that he died, and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-59-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-60-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither was he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-61-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-62-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-63-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-64-2-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-65-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly, that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-66-2-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-67-2-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But Peter said to them: Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-68-2-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-69-2-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-70-2-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>They therefore that received his word, were baptized; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-71-2-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-72-2-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And fear came upon every soul: many wonders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-73-2-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And all they that believed, were together, and had all things common.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-74-2-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided them to all, according as every one had need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-75-2-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-76-2-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily together such as should be saved.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-79-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-80-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And a certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb, was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-81-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He, when he had seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-82-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon him, said: Look upon us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-84-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise, and walk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-85-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and forthwith his feet and soles received strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-86-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he leaping up, stood, and walked, and went in with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-87-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-88-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-91-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-355-10-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And there was a certain man in Cæsarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian band;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-356-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>A religious man, and fearing God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and always praying to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-357-10-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him: Cornelius.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-358-10-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord? And he said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-359-10-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now send men to Joppe, and call hither one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-650-17-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-660-17-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-661-17-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-698-19-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-699-19-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-700-19-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John’s baptism.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-701-19-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance, saying: That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-702-19-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-703-19-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-704-19-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And all the men were about twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-705-19-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-706-19-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But when some were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord, before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-707-19-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And this continued for the space of two years, so that all they who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-708-19-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-709-19-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-710-19-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now some also of the Jewish exorcists who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-711-19-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-712-19-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-713-19-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them, and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-714-19-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-717-19-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So mightily grew the word of God, and was confirmed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-720-19-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-721-19-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-722-19-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Whom he calling together, with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-723-19-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And you see and hear, that this Paul by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: They are not gods which are made by hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-724-19-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing; yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-725-19-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Having heard these things, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-726-19-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And the whole city was filled with confusion; and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-727-19-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-728-19-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-729-19-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-730-19-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-731-19-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-732-19-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana, and of Jupiter’s offspring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-733-19-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-735-19-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-736-19-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-737-19-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse.

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-921-25-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the chief priests, and principal men of the Jews, went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-923-25-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Cæsarea, and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-928-25-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-929-25-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Paul said: I stand at Cæsar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-930-25-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For if I have injured them, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die.

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-931-25-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Cæsar? To Cæsar shalt thou go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-932-25-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea to salute Festus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-944-25-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-993-27-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-994-27-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and northwest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-996-27-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-997-27-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1022-27-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands; and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.</span></div>
