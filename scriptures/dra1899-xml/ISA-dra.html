<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The vision of Isaias the son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination to me. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Thy silver is turned into dross: thy wine is mingled with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, they run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow’s cause cometh not in to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dross, and I will take away all thy tin.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And I will restore thy judges as they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda and Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is no end of their treasures.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the elevated hills.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And idols shall be utterly destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen: because their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I will sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a hill in a fruitful place.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he fenced it in, and picked the stones out of it, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and set up a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And now, O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and ye men of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild grapes?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now I will shew you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted: I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And I will make it desolate: it shall not be pruned, and it shall not be digged: but briers and thorns shall come up: and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel: and the man of Juda, his pleasant plant: and I looked that he should do judgment, and behold iniquity: and do justice, and behold a cry.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Woe to you that join house to house and lay field to field, even to the end of the place: shall you alone dwell in the midst of the earth?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>These things are in my ears, saith the Lord of hosts: Unless many great and fair houses shall become desolate, without an inhabitant.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure, and thirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Woe to you that rise up early in the morning to follow drunkenness, and to drink till the evening, to be inflamed with wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The harp, and the lyre, and the timbrel, and the pipe, and wine are in your feasts: and the work of the Lord you regard not, nor do you consider the works of his hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses became as dung in the midst of the streets.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth: and behold they shall come with speed swiftly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>There is none that shall faint, nor labour among them: they shall not slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The hoofs of their horses shall be like the flint, and their wheels like the violence of a tempest.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the Lord spoke to me again, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Rasin, and the son of Romelia:</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Take counsel together, and it shall be defeated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath taught me, with a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds come from the south, it cometh from the desert from a terrible land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>A grievous vision is told me: he that is unfaithful dealeth unfaithfully: and he that is a spoiler, spoileth. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Mede: I have made all the mourning thereof to cease.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore are my loins filled with pain, anguish hath taken hold of me, as the anguish of a woman in labour: I fell down at the hearing of it, I was troubled at the seeing of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>My heart failed, darkness amazed me: Babylon my beloved is become a wonder to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Prepare the table, behold in the watchtower them that eat and drink: arise, ye princes, take up the shield.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For thus hath the Lord said to me: Go, and set a watchman: and whatsoever he shall see, let him tell.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he saw a chariot with two horsemen, a rider upon an ass, and a rider upon a camel: and he beheld them diligently with much heed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And a lion cried out: I am upon the watchtower of the Lord, standing continually by day: and I am upon my ward, standing whole nights.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Behold this man cometh, the rider upon the chariot with two horsemen, and he answered, and said: Babylon is fallen, she is fallen, and all the graven gods thereof are broken unto the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>O my thrashing, and the children of my floor, that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The burden of Duma calleth to me out of Seir: Watchman, what of the night? watchman, what of the night?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The watchman said: The morning cometh, also the night: if you seek, seek: return, come.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The burden in Arabia. In the forest at evening you shall sleep, in the paths of Dedanim.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For they are fled from before the swords, from the sword that hung over them, from the bent bow, from the face of a grievous battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For thus saith the Lord to me: Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Cedar shall be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the residue of the number of strong archers of the children of Cedar shall be diminished: for the Lord the God of Israel hath spoken it.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Full of clamour, a populous city, a joyous city: thy slain are not slain by the sword, nor dead in battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>All the princes are fled together, and are bound hard: all that were found, are bound together, they are fled far off.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He will crown thee with a crown of tribulation, he will toss thee like a ball into a large and spacious country: there shalt thou die, and there shall the chariot of thy glory be, the shame of the house of thy Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And I will drive thee out from thy station, and depose thee from thy ministry.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliacim the son of Helcias,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And I will clothe him with thy robe, and will strengthen him with thy girdle, and will give thy power into his hand: and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Juda.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder: and he shall open, and none shall shut: and he shall shut, and none shall open.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place, and he shall be for a throne of glory to the house of his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, divers kinds of vessels, every little vessel, from the vessels of cups even to every instrument of music.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower the glory of his joy, who were on the head of the fat valley, staggering with wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Behold the Lord is mighty and strong, as a storm of hail: a destroying whirlwind, as the violence of many waters overflowing, and sent forth upon a spacious land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the fading flower the glory of his joy, who is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as a hasty fruit before the ripeness of autumn: which when he that seeth it shall behold, as soon as he taketh it in his hand, he will eat it up.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>In that day the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory, and a garland of joy to the residue of his people:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and strength to them that return out of the battle to the gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But these also have been ignorant through wine, and through drunkenness have erred: the priest and the prophet have been ignorant through drunkenness, they are swallowed up with wine, they have gone astray in drunkenness, they have not known him that seeth, they have been ignorant of judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For all tables were full of vomit and filth, so that there was no more place.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand the hearing? them that are weaned from the milk, that are drawn away from the breasts.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For command, command again; command, command again; expect, expect again; expect, expect again: a little there, a little there.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For with the speech of lips, and with another tongue he will speak to this people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>To whom he said: This is my rest, refresh the weary, and this is my refreshing: and they would not hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the word of the Lord shall be to them: Command, command again; command, command again; expect, expect again; expect, expect again: a little there, a little there: that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, who rule over my people that is in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For you have said: We have entered into a league with death, and we have made a covenant with hell. When the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come upon us: for we have placed our hope in lies, and by falsehood we are protected.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lay a stone in the foundations of Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation. He that believeth, let him not hasten.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And I will set judgment in weight, and justice in measure: and hail shall overturn the hope of falsehood: and waters shall overflow its protection.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And your league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with hell shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge shall pass, you shall be trodden down by it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Whensoever it shall pass through, it shall take you away: because in the morning early it shall pass through, in the day and in the night, and vexation alone shall make you understand what you hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the bed is straitened, so that one must fall out, and a short covering cannot cover both.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For the Lord shall stand up as in the mountain of divisions: he shall be angry as in the valley which is in Gabaon: that he may do his work, his strange work: that he may perform his work, his work is strange to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And now do not mock, lest your bonds be tied strait. For I have heard of the Lord the God of hosts a consumption and a cutting short upon all the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Give ear, and hear my voice, hearken, and hear my speech.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Shall the ploughman plough all the day to sow, shall he open and harrow his ground?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Will he not, when he hath made plain the surface thereof, sow gith, and scatter cummin, and put wheat in order, and barley, and millet, and vetches in their bounds?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For he will instruct him in judgment: his God will teach him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For gith shall not be thrashed with saws, neither shall the cart wheel turn about upon cummin: but gith shall be beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a staff.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But bread corn shall be broken small: but the thrasher shall not thrash it for ever, neither shall the cart wheel hurt it, nor break it with its teeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>This also is come forth from the Lord God of hosts, to make his counsel wonderful, and magnify justice.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Woe to Ariel, to Ariel the city which David took: year is added to year: the solemnities are at an end.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And I will make a trench about Ariel, and it shall be in sorrow and mourning, and it shall be to me as Ariel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And I will make a circle round about thee, and will cast up a rampart against thee, and raise up bulwarks to besiege thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Thou shalt be brought down, thou shall speak out of the earth, and thy speech shall be heard out of the ground: and thy voice shall be from the earth like that of the python, and out of the ground thy speech shall mutter.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the multitude of them that fan thee, shall be like small dust: and as ashes passing away, the multitude of them that have prevailed against thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And it shall be at an instant suddenly. A visitation shall come from the Lord of hosts in thunder, and with earthquake, and with a great noise of whirlwind and tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the multitude of all nations that have fought against Ariel, shall be as the dream of a vision by night, and all that have fought, and besieged and prevailed against it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And as he that is hungry dreameth, and eateth, but when he is awake, his soul is empty: and as he that is thirsty dreameth, and drinketh, and after he is awake, is yet faint with thirst, and his soul is empty: so shall be the multitude of all the Gentiles, that have fought against mount Sion.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Be astonished, and wonder, waver, and stagger: be drunk, and not with wine: stagger, and not with drunkenness.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For the Lord hath mingled for you the spirit of a deep sleep, he will shut up your eyes, he will cover your prophets and princes, that see visions.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the vision of all shall be unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which when they shall deliver to one that is learned, they shall say: Read this: and he shall answer: I cannot, for it is sealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the book shall be given to one that knoweth no letters, and it shall be said to him: Read: and he shall answer: I know no letters.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the Lord said: Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips glorify me, but their heart is far from me, and they have feared me with the commandment and doctrines of men:</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>This thought of yours is perverse: as if the clay should think against the potter, and the work should say to the maker thereof: Thou madest me not: or the thing framed should say to him that fashioned it: Thou understandest not.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Is it not yet a very little while, and Libanus shall be turned into charmel, and charmel shall be esteemed as a forest?</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the meek shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For he that did prevail hath failed, the scorner is consumed, and they are all cut off that watched for iniquity:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>That made men sin by word, and supplanted him that reproved them in the gate, and declined in vain from the just.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Therefore thus saith the Lord to the house of Jacob, he that redeemed Abraham: Jacob shall not now be confounded, neither shall his countenance now be ashamed:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But when he shall see his children, the work of my hands in the midst of him sanctifying my name, and they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall glorify the God of Israel:</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Woe to you, apostate children, saith the Lord, that you would take counsel, and not of me: and would begin a web, and not by my spirit, that you might add sin upon sin:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Who walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth, hoping for help in the strength of Pharao, and trusting in the shadow of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the strength of Pharao shall be to your confusion, and the confidence of the shadow of Egypt to your shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For thy princes were in Tanis, and thy messengers came even to Hanes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They were all confounded at a people that could not profit them: they were no help, nor to any profit, but to confusion and to reproach.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The burden of the beasts of the south. In a land of trouble and distress, from whence come the lioness, and the lion, the viper and the flying basilisk, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of beasts, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not be able to profit them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For Egypt shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this: It is pride only, sit still.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now therefore go in and write for them upon box, and note it diligently in a book, and it shall be in the latter days for a testimony for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For it is a people that provoketh to wrath, and lying children, children that will not hear the law of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Who say to the seers: See not: and to them that behold: Behold not for us those things that are right: speak unto us pleasant things, see errors for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Take away from me the way, turn away the path from me, let the Holy One of Israel cease from before us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Because you have rejected this word, and have trusted in oppression and tumult, and have leaned upon it:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a breach that falleth, and is found wanting in a high wall, for the destruction thereof shall come on a sudden, when it is not looked for.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And it shall be broken small, as the potter’s vessel is broken all to pieces with mighty breaking, and there shall not a sherd be found of the pieces thereof, wherein a little fire may be carried from the hearth, or a little water be drawn out of the pit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel: If you return and be quiet, you shall be saved: in silence and in hope shall your strength be. And you would not:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But have said: No, but we will flee to horses: therefore shall you flee. And we will mount upon swift ones: therefore shall they be swifter that shall pursue after you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>A thousand men shall flee for fear of one: and for fear of five shall you flee, till you be left as the mast of ship on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign upon a hill.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore the Lord waiteth that he may have mercy on you: and therefore shall he be exalted sparing you: because the Lord is the God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the people of Sion shall dwell in Jerusalem: weeping thou shalt not weep, he will surely have pity on thee: at the voice of thy cry, as soon as he shall hear, he will answer thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And the Lord will give you spare bread, and short water: and will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thy eyes shall see thy teacher.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And thy ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it: and go not aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And thou shalt defile the plates of thy graven things of silver, and the garment of thy molten things of gold, and shalt cast them away as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman. Thou shalt say to it: Get thee hence.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And rain shall be given to thy seed, wheresoever thou shalt sow in the land: and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful, and fat. The lamb in that day shall feed at large in thy possession:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And thy oxen, and the ass colts that till the ground, shall eat mingled provender as it was winnowed in the floor.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every elevated hill rivers of running waters in the day of the slaughter of many, when the tower shall fall.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days: in the day when the Lord shall bind up the wound of his people, and shall heal the stroke of their wound.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar, his wrath burneth, and is heavy to bear: his lips are filled with indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>His breath as a torrent overflowing even to the midst of the neck, to destroy the nations unto nothing, and the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>You shall have a song as in the night of the sanctified solemnity, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come into the mountain of the Lord, to the Mighty One of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And the Lord shall make the glory of his voice to be heard, and shall shew the terror of his arm, in the threatening of wrath, and the flame of devouring fire: he shall crush to pieces with whirlwind, and hailstones.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>For at the voice of the Lord the Assyrian shall fear being struck with the rod.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And the passage of the rod shall be strongly grounded, which the Lord shall make to rest upon him with timbrels and harps, and in great battles he shall overthrow them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>For Topheth is prepared from yesterday, prepared by the king, deep, and wide. The nourishment thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord as a torrent of brimstone kindling it.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, trusting in horses, and putting their confidence in chariots, because they are many: and in horsemen, because they are very strong: and have not trusted in the Holy One of Israel, and have not sought after the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But he that is the wise one hath brought evil, and hath not removed his words: and he will rise up against the house of the wicked, and against the aid of them that work iniquity.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Thus saith the Lord: As if a grain be found in a cluster, and it be said: Destroy it not, because it is a blessing: so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the whole.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Juda a possessor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the plains shall be turned to folds of flocks, and the valley of Achor into a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And you, that have forsaken the Lord, that have forgotten my holy mount, that set a table for fortune, and offer libations upon it,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I will number you in the sword, and you shall all fall by slaughter: because I called and you did not answer: I spoke, and you did not hear: and you did evil in my eyes, and you have chosen the things that displease me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold my servants shall eat, and you shall be hungry: behold my servants shall drink, and you shall be thirsty.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Behold my servants shall rejoice, and you shall be confounded: behold my servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for grief of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And you shall leave your name for an execration to my elect: and the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>In which he that is blessed upon the earth, shall be blessed in God, amen: and he that sweareth in the earth, shall swear by God, amen: because the former distresses are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For behold I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former things shall not be in remembrance, and they shall not come upon the heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But you shall be glad and rejoice for ever in these things, which I create: for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and the people thereof joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>There shall no more be an infant of days there, nor an old man that shall not fill up his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of my people, and the works of their hands shall be of long continuance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>My elect shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their posterity with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear; as they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together; the lion and the ox shall eat straw; and dust shall be the serpent’s food: they shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Thus saith the Lord: Heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool: what is this house that you will build to me? and what is this place of my rest?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My hand made all these things, and all these things were made, saith the Lord. But to whom shall I have respect, but to him that is poor and little, and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my words?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He that sacrificeth an ox, is as if he slew a man: he that killeth a sheep in sacrifice, as if he should brain a dog: he that offereth an oblation, as if he should offer swine’s blood; he that remembereth incense, as if he should bless an idol. All these things have they chosen in their ways, and their soul is delighted in their abominations.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Wherefore I also will choose their mockeries, and will bring upon them the things they feared: because I called, and there was none that would answer; I have spoken, and they heard not; and they have done evil in my eyes, and have chosen the things that displease me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Hear the word of the Lord, you that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, and cast you out for my name’s sake, have said: Let the Lord be glorified, and we shall see in your joy: but they shall be confounded.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>A voice of the people from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to his enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Before she was in labour, she brought forth; before her time came to be delivered, she brought forth a man child.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Who hath ever heard such a thing? and who hath seen the like to this? shall the earth bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be brought forth at once, because Sion hath been in labour, and hath brought forth her children?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Shall not I that make others to bring forth children, myself bring forth, saith the Lord? shall I, that give generation to others, be barren, saith the Lord thy God?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>That you may suck, and be filled with the breasts of her consolations: that you may milk out, and flow with delights, from the abundance of her glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring upon her as it were a river of peace, and as an overflowing torrent the glory of the Gentiles, which you shall suck; you shall be carried at the breasts, and upon the knees they shall caress you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you, and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>You shall see and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants, and he shall be angry with his enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For behold the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind, to render his wrath in indignation, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For the Lord shall judge by fire, and by his sword unto all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They that were sanctified, and thought themselves clean in the gardens behind the gate within, they that did eat swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse: they shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But I know their works, and their thoughts: I come that I may gather them together with all nations and tongues: and they shall come and shall see my glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send of them that shall be saved, to the Gentiles into the sea, into Africa, and Lydia them that draw the bow: into Italy, and Greece, to the islands afar off, to them that have not heard of me, and have not seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory to the Gentiles:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and in coaches, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as if the children of Israel should bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And I will take of them to be priests, and Levites, saith the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For as the new heavens, and the new earth, which I will make to stand before me, saith the Lord: so shall your seed stand, and your name.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And there shall be month after month, and sabbath after sabbath: and all flesh shall come to adore before my face, saith the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they shall go out, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched: and they shall be a loathsome sight to all flesh.</span></div>
