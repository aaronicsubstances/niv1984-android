<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>
