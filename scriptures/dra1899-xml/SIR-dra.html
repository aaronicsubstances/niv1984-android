<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='fragment'><span>THE PROLOGUE: The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned. My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom: that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law. I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them when translated into another tongue. And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning. Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and her ways are everlasting commandments.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed, and who hath known her wise counsels?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest? and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is the God of dominion.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and numbered her, and measured her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall give joy, and gladness, and length of days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The love of God is honourable wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight, and by the knowledge of her great works.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen women, and is known with the just and faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall give joy and gladness.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in the days of his end he shall be blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from the fruits thereof.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are long-lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and religiousness of knowledge: but to sinners wisdom is an abomination.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For he that is without fear, cannot be justified: for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy shall be restored to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and that which is agreeable to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his treasures.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not to him with a double heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created: so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And they that remain shall know, that there is nothing better than the fear of God: and that there is nothing sweeter than to have regard to the commandments of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>It is great glory to follow the Lord: for length of days shall be received from him.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the altar. And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel: and finishing his service, on the altar, to honour the offering of the most high King,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered of the blood of the grape.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most high Prince.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to pray to the Almighty God the most High.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And the singers lifted up their voices, and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High, until the worship of the Lord was perfected, and they had finished their office.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God with his lips, and to glory in his name:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother’s womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>May he grant us joyfulness of heart, and that there be peace in our days in Israel for ever:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us, to deliver us in his days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>There are two nations which my soul abhorreth: and the third is no nation, which I hate:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jesus the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, hath written in this book the doctrine of wisdom and instruction, who renewed wisdom from his heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things and he that layeth them up in his heart, shall be wise always.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>For if he do them, he shall be strong to do all things: because the light of God guideth his steps.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 51</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>A PRAYER of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And my life was drawing near to hell beneath.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end I will seek after her, and she flourished as a grape soon ripe.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right way, from my youth up I sought after her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I bowed down my ear a little, and received her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>I found much wisdom in myself, and I profited much therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal for good, and shall not be confounded.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing it I have been confirmed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my ignorance of her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the house of discipline.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Why are ye slow? and what do you say of these things? your souls are exceeding thirsty.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and you shall not be confounded in his praise.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time.</span></div>
