<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that, which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly; and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Keep yourselves therefore from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For justice is perpetual and immortal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But the wicked with works and words have called it to them: and esteeming it a friend have fallen away, and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.</span></div>
