      <content>They saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him: Shew us the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And when he had shewn them, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but that man and all his kindred they let go:</content>

  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Chapter 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weepers, and said: I made you go out of Egypt, and have brought you into the land for which I swore to your fathers: and I promised that I would not make void my covenant with you for ever:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>On condition that you should not make a league with the inhabitants of this land, but should throw down their altars: and you would not hear my voice: why have you done this?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your face: that you may have enemies, and their gods may be your ruin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, they lifted up their voice, and wept.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the name of that place was called, The place of weepers, or of tears: and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And Josue sent away the people, and the children of Israel went every one to his own possession to hold it:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And they served the Lord all his days, and the days of the ancients, that lived a long time after him, and who knew all the works of the Lord, which he had done for Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And Josue the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old,</content>

      <content>And they buried him in the borders of his possession in Thamnathsare in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount Gaas.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And all that generation was gathered to their fathers: and there arose others that knew not the Lord, and the works which he had done for Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served Baalim.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And they left the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt: and they followed strange gods, and the gods of the people that dwelt round about them, and they adored them: and they provoked the Lord to anger.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Forsaking him, and serving Baal and Astaroth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And the Lord being angry against Israel, delivered them into the hands of plunderers: who took them and sold them to their enemies, that dwelt round about: neither could they stand against their enemies:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the Lord was upon them, as he had said, and as he had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the Lord raised up judges, to deliver them from the hands of those that oppressed them: but they would not hearken to them,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Committing fornication with strange gods, and adoring them. They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked: and hearing the commandments of the Lord, they did all things contrary.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their days he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the oppressors.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving them and adoring them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left, when he died:</content>
    </verse>

      <content>That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue.</content>

      <content>So the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite:</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And he made himself a two-edged sword, with a haft in the midst of the length of the palm of the hand, and was girded therewith under his garment on the right thigh.</content>

      <content>And he presented the gifts to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was exceeding fat.</content>

      <content>Then returning from Galgal, where the idols were, he said to the king: I have a secret message to thee, O king. And he commanded silence: and all being gone out that were about him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Aod went in to him: now he was sitting in a summer parlour alone, and he said: I have a word from God to thee. And he forthwith rose up from his throne,</content>

    <verse num="21">
      <content>And Aod put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>With such force that the haft went in after the blade into the wound, and was closed up with the abundance of fat. So that he did not draw out the dagger, but left it in his body as he had struck it in. And forthwith by the secret parts of nature the excrements of the belly came out.</content>

      <content>But Aod carefully shutting the doors of the parlour and locking them,</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Went out by a postern door. And the king&#8217;s servants going in, saw the doors of the parlour shut, and they said: Perhaps he is easing nature in his summer parlour.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And waiting a long time till they were ashamed, and seeing that no man opened the door, they took a key: and opening, they found their lord lying dead on the ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But Aod, while they were in confusion, escaped, and passed by the place of the idols, from whence he had returned. And he came to Seirath:</content>

      <content>And forthwith he sounded the trumpet in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel went down with him, he himself going in the front.</content>
