    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes, he was not warm.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>His servants therefore said to him: Let us seek for our lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom, and warm our lord the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the coasts of Israel, and they found Abisag a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And the damsel was exceeding beautiful, and she slept with the king: and served him, but the king did not know her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And Adonias the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And he conferred with Joab the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar the priest, who furthered Adonias&#8217;s side.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David&#8217;s army was not with Adonias.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren the king&#8217;s sons, and all the men of Juda, the king&#8217;s servants:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>But Nathan the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And Nathan said to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Haggith reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now then come, take my counsel and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord O king, swear to me thy handmaid, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber: now the king was very old, and Abisag the Sunamitess ministered to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>She answered and said: My lord, thou didst swear to thy handmaid by the Lord thy God, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And behold now Adonias reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing of it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the king&#8217;s sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the general of the army: but Solomon thy servant he invited not.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And now, my lord O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And they told the king, saying: Nathan the prophet is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Nathan said: My lord O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king&#8217;s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But me thy servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Solomon thy servant he hath not invited.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And king David answered and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>The king swore and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Even as I swore to thee by the Lord the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And Bethsabee bowing with her face to the earth worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>King David also said: Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And let Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And Banaias the son of Joiada answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the Lord the God of my lord the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>So Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet went down, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And Sadoc the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: God save king Solomon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end: Joab also hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>While he yet spoke, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord king David hath appointed Solomon king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>And hath sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king&#8217;s mule.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>And Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>Moreover Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>And the king&#8217;s servants going in have blessed our lord king David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>And he said: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose and every man went his way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose, and went, and took hold on the horn of the altar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias, fearing king Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="52">
      <content>And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.</content>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Chapter 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son Solomon, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage, and shew thyself a man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses: that thou mayest understand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Sarvia hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to hell in peace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom thy brother.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Thou hast also with thee Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with a sword:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to hell.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And Adonias the son of Haggith came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? he answered: Peaceable.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother&#8217;s: for it was appointed him by the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Now therefore I ask one petition of thee: turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he said: I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag the Sunamitess to wife.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king&#8217;s mother, and she sat on his right hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee, do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother, ask: for I must not turn away thy face.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And she said: Let Abisag the Sunamitess be given to Adonias thy brother to wife.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag the Sunamitess for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom: for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Sarvia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And now as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias the son of Joiada, who slew him, and he died.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And the king said also to Abiathar the priest: Go to Anathoth to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Silo.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord and laid hold on the horn of the altar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias the son of Joiada, saying: Go, kill him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him: Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And the king said to him: Do as he hath said: and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, because he murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing it, Abner the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, general of the army of Juda.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed and his house, and to his throne be peace for ever from the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>So Banaias the son of Joiada went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And the king appointed Banaias the son of Joiada in his room over the army, and Sadoc the priest he put in the place of Abiathar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any whither.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the brook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And Semei said to the king: The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem, many days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis the son of Maacha the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis to Geth to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And it was told Solomon that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any whither, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father: the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>So the king commanded Banaias the son of Joiada: and he went out and struck him, and he died.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made affinity with Pharao the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: for there was no temple built to the name of the Lord until that day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David his father, only he sacrificed in the high places: and burnt incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there: for that was the great high place: a thousand victims for holocausts did Solomon offer upon that altar in Gabaon.</content>

      <content>And the word was pleasing to the Lord that Solomon had asked such a thing.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life or riches, nor the lives of thy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment,</content>

      <content>Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given thee a wise and understanding heart, insomuch that there hath been no one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.</content>

      <content>Of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel: You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come in to yours: for they will most certainly turn away your heart to follow their gods.

      <content>And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took men with them from Pharan, and went into Egypt to Pharao the king of Egypt: who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned him land.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife, the own sister of his wife Taphnes the queen.</content>

      <content>And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son Genubath, and Taphnes brought him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children.</content>

      <content>And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the general of the army was dead, he said to Pharao: Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.</content>

      <content>And he was an adversary to Israel, all the days of Solomon: and this is the evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel, and he reigned in Syria.</content>

      <content>Jeroboam also the son of Nabat an Ephrathite of Sareda, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king.</content>

    <verse num="29">
      <content>So it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahias the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the way: and they two were alone in the field.</content>

    <verse num="32">
      <content>But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant David, and Jerusalem the city, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:</content>

      <content>Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Chamos the god of Moab, and Moloch the god of the children of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do justice before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments, as did David his father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant&#8217;s sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my precepts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>But I will take away the kingdom out of his son&#8217;s hand and will give thee ten tribes:</content>

      <content>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.</content>

      <content>If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my commandments and my precepts, as David my servant did: I will be with thee, and will build thee up a faithful house, as I built a house for David, and I will deliver Israel to thee:</content>

      <content>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose, and fled into Egypt to Sesac the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.</content>
