    <verse num="1">
      <content>Tobias of the tribe and city of Nephtali, (which is in the upper parts of Galilee above Naasson, beyond the way that leadeth to the west, having on the right hand the city of Sephet,)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar king of the Assyrians, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of truth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But every day gave all he could get to his brethren his fellow captives, that were of his kindred.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And when he was younger than any of the tribe of Nephtali, yet did he no childish thing in his work.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Moreover when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam king of Israel had made, he alone fled the company of all,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And went to Jerusalem to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his firstfruits, and his tithes,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the law of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But when he was a man, he took to wife Anna of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own name,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And when by the captivity he with his wife and his son and all his tribe was come to the city of Ninive,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>(When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul and never was defiled with their meats.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>He therefore went to all that were in captivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And when he was come to Rages a city of the Medes, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And when amongst a great multitude of his kindred, he saw Gabelus in want, who was one of his tribe, taking a note of his hand he gave him the aforesaid sum of money.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But after a long time, Salmanasar the king being dead, when Sennacherib his son, who reigned in his place, had a hatred for the children of Israel:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Tobias daily went among all his kindred, and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>He fed the hungry, and gave clothes to the naked, and was careful to bury the dead, and they that were slain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And when king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from Judea by reason of the slaughter that God had made about him for his blasphemy, and being angry slew many of the children of Israel, Tobias buried their bodies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But when it was told the king, he commanded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But Tobias fleeing naked away with his son and with his wife, lay concealed, for many loved him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But after forty-five days, the king was killed by his own sons.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And Tobias returned to his house, and all his substance was restored to him.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Chapter 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>But after this, when there was a festival of the Lord, and a good dinner was prepared in Tobias&#8217;s house,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>He said to his son: Go, and bring some of our tribe that fear God, to feast with us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And when he had gone, returning he told him, that one of the children of Israel lay slain in the street. And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by Amos the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: Once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now it happened one day, that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow&#8217;s nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For whereas he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he repined not against God because the evil of blindness had befallen him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For as the kings insulted over holy Job: so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For we are the children of saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Now Anna his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen: restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>At these words his wife being angry answered: It is evident thy hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And with these, and other such like words she upbraided him.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3" preferred_title="Chapter 3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then Tobias sighed, and began to pray with tears,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Saying: Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just, and all thy ways mercy, and truth, and judgment:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins, neither remember my offences, nor those of my parents.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to live.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now it happened on the same day, that Sara daughter of Raguel, in Rages a city of the Medes, received a reproach from one of her father&#8217;s servant maids,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Because she had been given to seven husbands, and a devil named Asmodeus had killed them, at their first going in unto her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbands.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands? At these words she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But continuing in prayer with tears besought God, that he would deliver her from this reproach.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And it came to pass on the third day, when she was making an end of her prayer, blessing the Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>She said: Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers: who when thou hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never coveted a husband, and have kept my soul clean from all lust.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy of me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For thy counsel is not in man&#8217;s power.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned: and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For thou art not delighted in our being lost: because after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyfulness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of the glory of the most high God:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael was sent to heal them both, whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4" preferred_title="Chapter 4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Therefore when Tobias thought that his prayer was heard that he might die, he called to him Tobias his son,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And said to him: Hear, my son, the words of my mouth, and lay them as a foundation in thy heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>When God shall take my soul, thou shalt bury my body: and thou shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for thee in her womb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And when she also shall have ended the time of her life, bury her by me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And all the days of thy life have God in thy mind: and take heed thou never consent to sin, nor transgress the commandments of the Lord our God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Give alms out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>According to thy ability be merciful.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>If thou have much give abundantly: if thou have little, take care even so to bestow willingly a little.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward for the day of necessity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high God, to all them that give it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Never suffer pride to reign in thy mind, or in thy words: for from it all perdition took its beginning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>If any man hath done any work for thee, immediately pay him his hire, and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>See thou never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done to thee by another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy, and with thy garments cover the naked.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Lay out thy bread, and thy wine upon the burial of a just man, and do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Seek counsel always of a wise man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Bless God at all times: and desire of him to direct thy ways, and that all thy counsels may abide in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>I tell thee also, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while thou wast yet a child, to Gabelus, in Rages a city of the Medes, and I have a note of his hand with me:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Now therefore inquire how thou mayst go to him, and receive of him the foresaid sum of money, and restore to him the note of his hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Fear not, my son: we lead indeed a poor life, but we shall have many good things if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is good.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5" preferred_title="Chapter 5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth not me, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, good young man?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And Raphael the angel answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.</content>

  <chapter num="6" preferred_title="Chapter 6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying: Sir, he cometh upon me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And the angel said to him: Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee. And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Then the angel said to him: Take out the entrails of this fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way: the rest they salted as much as might serve them, till they came to Rages the city of the Medes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Then Tobias asked the angel, and said to him: I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And the angel, answering, said to him: If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman, so that they come no more to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured.</content>

      <content>And Tobias said to him: Where wilt thou that we lodge?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And the angel answering, said: Here is one whose name is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter named Sara, but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>All his substance is due to thee, and thou must take her to wife.</content>
