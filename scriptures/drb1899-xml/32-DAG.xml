    <verse num="1">
      <content>In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and beseiged it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim the king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure house of his god.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And the king spoke to Asphenez the master of the eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, and of the king&#8217;s seed and of the princes,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Children in whom there was no blemish, well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, acute in knowledge, and instructed in science, and such as might stand in the king&#8217;s palace, that he might teach them the learning, and tongue of the Chaldeans.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the king appointed them a daily provision, of his own meat, and of the wine of which he drank himself, that being nourished three years, afterwards they might stand before the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now there was among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the master of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltassar: to Ananias, Sidrach: to Misael, Misach: and to Azarias, Abdenago.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king&#8217;s table, nor with the wine which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel: I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed you meat and drink: who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths your equals, you shall endanger my head to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given us to eat, and water to drink:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king&#8217;s meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And after ten days their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king&#8217;s meat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So Malasar took their portions, and the wine that they should drink: and he gave them pulse.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And to these children God gave knowledge, and understanding in every book, and wisdom: but to Daniel the understanding also of all visions and dreams.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And when the days were ended, after which the king had ordered they should be brought in: the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And when the king had spoken to them, there were not found among them all such as Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias: and they stood in the king&#8217;s presence.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the diviners, and wise men, that were in all his kingdom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</content>

  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Chapter 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuchodonosor had a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream went out of his mind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise men, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans: to declare to the king his dreams: so they came and stood before the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And the king said to them: I saw a dream: and being troubled in mind I know not what I saw.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the interpretation thereof.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the king answering said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my mind: unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof, you shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour: therefore tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation of it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>The king answered, and said: I know for certain that you seek to gain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>If therefore you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence concerning you, that you have also framed a lying interpretation, and full of deceit, to speak before me till the time pass away. Tell me therefore the dream, that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king, neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult; nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain: and Daniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of Arioch the general of the king&#8217;s army, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Daniel went in and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question and declare it to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias his companions:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And speaking he said: Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore: for wisdom and fortitude are his.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms and establisheth them, giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in darkness: and light is with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us, the king&#8217;s discourse.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers can declare to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer&#8217;s thrashingfloor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>Thou art a king of kings: and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and glory:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou therefore art the head of gold.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee, of silver: and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over all the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break and destroy all these.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter&#8217;s clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people, and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms, and itself shall stand for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces, the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>And the king spoke to Daniel, and said: Verily your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of hidden things: seeing thou couldst discover this secret.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon, and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of Babylon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago over the works of the province of Babylon: but Daniel himself was in the king&#8217;s palace.</content>

  <chapter num="3" preferred_title="Chapter 3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad, and he set it up in the plain of Dura of the province of Babylon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, the rulers, and governors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, and rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all the princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue, which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is commanded, O nations, tribes, and languages:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and of the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the psaltery, and of the symphony, and of all kind of music; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But if any man shall not fall down and adore, he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>Upon this therefore, at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music: all the nations, tribes, and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And said to king Nabuchodonosor: O king, live for ever:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Thou, O king, hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall prostrate himself, and adore the golden statue:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And that if any man shall not fall down and adore, he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</content>

    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, O king, have slighted thy decree: they worship not thy gods, nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up?</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter.</content>

      <content>For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king.</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire.</content>

      <content>And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their shoes, and their garments.</content>

    <verse num="22">
      <content>For the king&#8217;s commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago.</content>

      <content>But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire.</content>

      <content>And now we cannot open our mouths: we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee.</content>

    <verse num="52">
      <content>So when they were put asunder one from the other, he called one of them, and said to him: O thou that art grown old in evil days, now are thy sins come out, which thou hast committed before:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>In judging unjust judgments, oppressing the innocent, and letting the guilty to go free, whereas the Lord saith: The innocent and the just thou shalt not kill.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="54">
      <content>Now then, if thou sawest her, tell me under what tree thou sawest them conversing together. He said: Under a mastic tree.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="55">
      <content>And Daniel said: Well hast thou lied against thy own head: for behold the angel of God having received the sentence of him, shall cut thee in two.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="56">
      <content>And having put him aside, he commanded that the other should come, and he said to him: O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thy heart:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="57">
      <content>Thus did you do to the daughters of Israel, and they for fear conversed with you: but a daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="58">
      <content>Now therefore tell me, under what tree didst thou take them conversing together. And he answered: Under a holm tree.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="59">
      <content>And Daniel said to him: Well hast thou also lied against thy own head: for the angel of the Lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in two, and to destroy you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="60">
      <content>With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and they blessed God, who saveth them that trust in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="61">
      <content>And they rose up against the two elders, (for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth,) and they did to them as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="62">
      <content>To fulfil the law of Moses: and they put them to death, and innocent blood was saved in that day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="63">
      <content>But Helcias and his wife praised God, for their daughter Susanna, with Joakim her husband, and all her kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.</content>

    <verse num="64">
      <content>And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day, and thenceforward.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>And Daniel was the king&#8217;s guest, and was honoured above all his friends.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel: and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and sixty vessels of wine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>The king also worshipped him, and went every day to adore him: but Daniel adored his God. And the king said to him: Why dost thou not adore Bel?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And he answered, and said to him: Because I do not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, that created heaven and earth, and hath power over all flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then Daniel smiled and said: O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the king being angry called for his priests, and said to them: If you tell me not, who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But if you can shew that Bel eateth these things, Daniel shall die, because he hath blasphemed against Bel. And Daniel said to the king: Be it done according to thy word.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Now the priests of Bel were seventy, beside their wives, and little ones, and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And the priests of Bel said: Behold we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death, or else Daniel that hath lied against us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And they little regarded it, because they had made under the table a secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and consumed those things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before Bel: and Daniel commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he sifted them all over the temple before the king: and going forth they shut the door, and having sealed it with the king&#8217;s ring, they departed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But the priests went in by night, according to their custom, with their wives and their children: and they ate and drank up all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And the king arose early in the morning, and Daniel with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the king said: Are the seals whole, Daniel? And he answered: They are whole, O king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried out with a loud voice: Great art thou, O Bel, and there is not any deceit with thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And Daniel laughed: and he held the king that he should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps these are.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and women, and children. And the king was angry.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Then he took the priests, and their wives, and their children: and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>The king therefore put them to death, and delivered Bel into the power of Daniel: who destroyed him, and his temple.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And there was a great dragon in that place, and the Babylonians worshipped him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And the king said to Daniel: Behold thou canst not say now, that this is not a living god: adore him therefore.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And Daniel said: I adore the Lord my God: for he is the living God: but that is no living god.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But give me leave, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or club. And the king said: I give thee leave.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and boiled them together: and he made lumps, and put them into the dragon&#8217;s mouth, and the dragon burst asunder. And he said: Behold him whom you worshipped.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And when the Babylonians had heard this, they took great indignation: and being gathered together against the king, they said: The king is become a Jew. He hath destroyed Bel, he hath killed the dragon, and he hath put the priests to death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And they came to the king, and said: Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thy house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And the king saw that they pressed upon him violently: and being constrained by necessity he delivered Daniel to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And they cast him into the den of lions, and he was there six days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given to them two carcasses every day, and two sheep: but then they were not given unto them, that they might devour Daniel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Now there was in Judea a prophet called Habacuc, and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl: and was going into the field, to carry it to the reapers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And the angel of the Lord said to Habacuc: Carry the dinner which thou hast into Babylon to Daniel, who is in the lions&#8217; den.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And Habacuc said: Lord, I never saw Babylon, nor do I know the den.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And the angel of the Lord took him by the top of his head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and set him in Babylon over the den in the force of his spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And Habacuc cried, saying: O Daniel, thou servant of God, take the dinner that God hath sent thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>And Daniel said: Thou hast remembered me, O God, and thou hast not forsaken them that love thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>And Daniel arose and ate. And the angel of the Lord presently set Habacuc again in his own place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and he came to the den, and looked in, and behold Daniel was sitting in the midst of the lions.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>And the king cried out with a loud voice, saying: Great art thou, O Lord the God of Daniel. And he drew him out of the lions&#8217; den.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>But those that had been the cause of his destruction, he cast into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>Then the king said: Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth fear the God of Daniel: for he is the Saviour, working signs, and wonders in the earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions&#8217; den.</content>
