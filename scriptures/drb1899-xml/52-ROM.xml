      <content>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,</content>

      <content>Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name;</content>

      <content>Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>First I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, because your faith is spoken of in the whole world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you, by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts, and of creeping things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity, whisperers,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</content>

    <verse num="31">
      <content>Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.</content>

      <content>What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh.</content>

      <content>As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:</content>

    <verse num="12">

      <content>In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:</content>

      <content>For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.</content>

      <content>But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.</content>
