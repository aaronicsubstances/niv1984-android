    <verse num="1">
      <content>James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Wherefore casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man&#8217;s religion is vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one&#8217;s self unspotted from this world.</content>

  <chapter num="2" preferred_title="Chapter 2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also. Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead.</content>

  <chapter num="3" preferred_title="Chapter 3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Behold also ships, whereas they are great, and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Even so the tongue is indeed a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body, and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For every nature of beasts and of birds, and of serpents, and of the rest, is tamed, and hath been tamed, by the nature of man:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes; or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts; glory not, and be not liars against the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For where envying and contention is, there is inconstancy, and every evil work.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But the wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace.</content>
