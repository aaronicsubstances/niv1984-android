      <content>Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</content>

      <content>Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now, though you see him not, you believe: and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;</content>

      <content>Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify: when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ, and the glories that should follow:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you they ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to look.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,</content>

      <content>As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former desires of your ignorance:</content>

      <content>But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in all manner of conversation holy:</content>
    </verse>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons, judgeth according to every one&#8217;s work: converse in fear during the time of your sojourning here.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers:</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled,</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the last times for you,</content>

      <content>Who through him are faithful in God, who raised him up from the dead, and hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</content>

    <verse num="22">
      <content>Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly love, from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Being born again not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For all flesh is as grass; and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass is withered, and the flower thereof is fallen away.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Wherefore laying away all malice, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detractions,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God&#8217;s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</content>

      <content>As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.</content>

      <content>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.</content>

  <chapter num="3" preferred_title="Chapter 3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Considering your chaste conversation with fear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For after this manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any disturbance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel, and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Let him decline from evil, and do good: let him seek after peace and pursue it:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers: but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But if also you suffer any thing for justice&#8217; sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.</content>

  <chapter num="4" preferred_title="Chapter 4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sins:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh, not after the desires of men, but according to the will of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and unlawful worshipping of idols.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Wherein they think it strange, that you run not with them into the same confusion of riotousness, speaking evil of you.</content>

      <content>Who shall render account to him, who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: that they might be judged indeed according to men, in the flesh; but may live according to God, in the Spirit.</content>

      <content>But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore, and watch in prayers.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any minister, let him do it, as of the power, which God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try you, as if some new thing happened to you;</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory, and power of God, and that which is his Spirit, resteth upon you.</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a railer, or coveter of other men&#8217;s things.</content>

      <content>But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.</content>

      <content>For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of God?</content>

      <content>And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</content>
