      <content>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For the life was manifested; and we have seen and do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us:</content>

      <content>And this is the declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him there is no darkness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</content>

      <content>He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected; and by this we know that we are in him.</content>

      <content>He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also to walk, even as he walked.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Again a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true both in him and in you; because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.</content>

      <content>He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no scandal in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.</content>

      <content>I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name&#8217;s sake.</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him, who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.</content>

      <content>They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us; but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us.</content>

      <content>I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son.</content>

      <content>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know, that, when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Whosoever is born of God, committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him, and he can not sin, because he is born of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just, is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:</content>

      <content>He that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is charity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.</content>
