        <verse num="8">
            <content>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</content>

        <verse num="9">
            <content>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</content>

            <content>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</content>

        <verse num="13">
            <content>and worked them ruthlessly.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</content>

            <content>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</content>

        <verse num="17">
            <content>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</content>

            <content>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</content>

            <content>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</content>

        <verse num="5">
            <content>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</content>

            <content>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</content>

            <content>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</content>

            <content>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</content>

            <content>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, </content>

        <verse num="11">
            <content>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</content>

        <verse num="12">
            <content>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</content>

            <content>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</content>

        <verse num="14">
            <content>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</content>

        <verse num="16">
            <content>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</content>

            <content>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</content>

            <content>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</content>
        </verse>

            <content>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</content>

        <verse num="7">
            <content>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</content>
