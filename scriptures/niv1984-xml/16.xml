            <content>The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>They said to me, "Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>Then I said: "O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>"Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, `If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>"They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man." I was cupbearer to the king.</content>

    <chapter num="2">
        <verse num="1">
            <content>In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before;</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?" It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>I also said to him, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites. </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal </content>
            <note_ref>1</note_ref>
            <content> Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."</content>
