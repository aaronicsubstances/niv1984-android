            <content>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>but each of them had four faces and four wings.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about </content>

            <content> as the creatures went.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, </content>
            <note_ref>5</note_ref>
            <content> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="25">
            <content>Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="26">
            <content>Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, </content>
            <note_ref>6</note_ref>
            <content> and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="27">
            <content>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="28">
            <content>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days--overwhelmed.</content>

        <verse num="16">
            <content>At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:</content>

            <content>When I say to a wicked man, `You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will die for </content>

        <verse num="20">
            <content>"Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since you did not warn him, he will die for his sin.

        </verse>
        <verse num="21">

            <content>So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</content>
