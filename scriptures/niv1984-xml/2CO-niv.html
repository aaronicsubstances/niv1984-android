<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn--conflicts on the outside, fears within.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136-7-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137-7-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138-7-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139-7-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140-7-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148-8-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149-8-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150-8-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151-8-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152-8-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153-8-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154-8-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> --see that you also excel in this grace of giving.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155-8-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156-8-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157-8-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158-8-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159-8-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160-8-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161-8-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162-8-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163-8-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164-8-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165-8-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166-8-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167-8-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168-8-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169-8-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170-8-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.</span></div>
