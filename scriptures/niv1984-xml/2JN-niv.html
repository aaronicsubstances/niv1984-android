<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever: </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. </span></div>
