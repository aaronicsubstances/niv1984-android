<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, `Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Therefore this is what the LORD says: `You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, `Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>They replied, "He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, `Come down!'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, `Come down at once!'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha replied, "but do not speak of it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," he replied, "but do not speak of it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them walked on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours--otherwise not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"Look," they said, "we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley." "No," Elisha replied, "do not send them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the LORD says: `I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the water has remained wholesome to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Joram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" "I will go with you," he replied. "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"By what route shall we attack?" he asked. "Through the Desert of Edom," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"What!" exclaimed the king of Israel. "Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD through him?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." "No," the king of Israel answered, "because it was the LORD who called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or even notice you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and he said, "This is what the LORD says: Make this valley full of ditches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For this is what the LORD says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>This is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; he will also hand Moab over to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was--water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red--like blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"That's blood!" they said. "Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72-3-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73-3-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74-3-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75-3-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131-5-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: "Why have you torn your robes?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147-5-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149-5-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"As soon as this letter reaches you, since your master's sons are with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282-10-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne. Then fight for your master's house."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-283-10-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But they were terrified and said, "If two kings could not resist him, how can we?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284-10-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: "We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285-10-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286-10-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287-10-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, "They have brought the heads of the princes." Then Jehu ordered, "Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288-10-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289-10-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Know then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The LORD has done what he promised through his servant Elijah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290-10-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291-10-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292-10-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They said, "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-293-10-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"Take them alive!" he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked--forty-two men. He left no survivor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-294-10-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Recab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, "Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?" "I am," Jehonadab answered. "If so," said Jehu, "give me your hand." So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295-10-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." Then he had him ride along in his chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-296-10-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab's family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-297-10-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-298-10-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his ministers and all his priests.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-299-10-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Jehu said, "Call an assembly in honor of Baal." So they proclaimed it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300-10-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the ministers of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301-10-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring robes for all the ministers of Baal." So he brought out robes for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302-10-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the ministers of Baal, "Look around and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you--only ministers of Baal."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303-10-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: "If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304-10-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: "Go in and kill them; let no one escape."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305-10-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307-10-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310-10-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.</span></div>
