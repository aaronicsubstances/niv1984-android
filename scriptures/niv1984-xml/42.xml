        </verse>

            <content>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</content>

        <verse num="5">
            <content>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="25">
            <content>"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."</content>

        <verse num="26">
            <content>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="30">
            <content>But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.</content>

            <content>"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="35">
            <content>The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called </content>

            <content>"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="39">
            <content>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</content>

        <verse num="40">
            <content>where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</content>
