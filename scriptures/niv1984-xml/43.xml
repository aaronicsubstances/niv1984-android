            <content>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. </content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</content>

        <verse num="13">
            <content>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."</content>

        <verse num="16">
            <content>Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</content>

        <verse num="17">
            <content>The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</content>

            <content>When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"</content>

        <verse num="24">
            <content>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</content>

        <verse num="25">
            <content>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. </content>
