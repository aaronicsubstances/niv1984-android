        <verse num="20">
            <content>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</content>

        <verse num="26">
            <content>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</content>

        <verse num="27">
            <content>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</content>
