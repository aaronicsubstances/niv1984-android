<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For John baptized with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He said to them: "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> from the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In those days Peter stood up among the believers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and said, "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>he was one of our number and shared in this ministry."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>(With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"For," said Peter, "it is written in the book of Psalms, "`May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and, "`May another take his place of leadership.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315-9-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-316-9-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-317-9-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318-9-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319-9-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-320-9-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Yes, Lord," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321-9-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322-9-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323-9-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324-9-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325-9-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326-9-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327-9-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328-9-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329-9-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330-9-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331-9-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332-9-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-333-9-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335-9-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336-9-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337-9-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338-9-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339-9-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340-9-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358-10-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372-10-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373-10-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374-10-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup><span> men are looking for you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-378-10-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438-12-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439-12-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-440-12-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-441-12-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-442-12-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443-12-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444-12-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445-12-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals." And Peter did so. "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me," the angel told him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446-12-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447-12-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448-12-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450-12-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458-12-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644-17-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647-17-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648-17-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650-17-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651-17-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652-17-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655-17-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-672-18-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-673-18-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-674-18-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-675-18-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads!

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-676-18-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-677-18-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-678-18-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-680-18-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-681-18-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-682-18-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-683-18-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-684-18-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law--settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-685-18-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So he had them ejected from the court.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-686-18-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-687-18-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693-18-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695-18-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-700-19-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-701-19-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> you believed?"

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-703-19-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-707-19-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-708-19-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-709-19-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712-19-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-713-19-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-727-19-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-857-23-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-858-23-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-859-23-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-860-23-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Those who were standing near Paul said, "You dare to insult God's high priest?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-861-23-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: `Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-862-23-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, "My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-863-23-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-864-23-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-865-23-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with this man," they said. "What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-866-23-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867-23-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-868-23-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-869-23-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>More than forty men were involved in this plot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-870-23-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-871-23-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-872-23-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when the son of Paul's sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-873-23-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-874-23-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-875-23-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-876-23-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He said: "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-877-23-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-878-23-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-879-23-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, "Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">b</a>]</sup><span> to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-880-23-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-881-23-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He wrote a letter as follows: </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-883-23-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-884-23-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-885-23-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-886-23-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-887-23-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-888-23-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-889-23-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-890-23-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-891-23-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers get here." Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-895-24-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-898-24-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-902-24-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-903-24-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: "I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-904-24-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-906-24-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-907-24-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-909-24-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-912-24-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-924-25-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>where the chief priests and Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-925-25-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>They urgently requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-930-25-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Paul made his defense: "I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-931-25-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-987-27-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-989-27-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-990-27-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-991-27-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-992-27-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-993-27-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-994-27-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-1" id="niv-verse-27-1">a</a>]</sup><span> So Paul warned them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-995-27-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-996-27-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-997-27-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-998-27-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-999-27-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the "northeaster," swept down from the island.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1000-27-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1001-27-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1002-27-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1003-27-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1004-27-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1005-27-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1006-27-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1007-27-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1011-27-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1012-27-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-2" id="niv-verse-27-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1013-27-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-3" id="niv-verse-27-3">c</a>]</sup><span> deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-4" id="niv-verse-27-4">d</a>]</sup><span> deep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1014-27-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1015-27-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1016-27-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1017-27-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1018-27-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he said, "you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1019-27-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1020-27-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1021-27-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1022-27-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Altogether there were 276 of us on board.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1023-27-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1024-27-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1025-27-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1026-27-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1027-27-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1028-27-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1029-27-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.</span></div>
