<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly--my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> as well--the delights of the heart of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God.
