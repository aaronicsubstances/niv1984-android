<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and worked them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I drew him out of the water."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey--the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> will worship God on this mountain."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, `The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, `What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> This is what you are to say to the Israelites: `I AM has sent me to you.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, `The LORD, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, `The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-- appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--a land flowing with milk and honey.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, `The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, `The LORD did not appear to you'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has appeared to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> like snow.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then say to Pharaoh, `This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met [Moses] </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and was about to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched [Moses'] feet with it. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, `Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: `I will not give you any more straw.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, "Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, `Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are--lazy! That is why you keep saying, `Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: `How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians--something neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Moses answered, "We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you--if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>No! Have only the men go; and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail--everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over Egypt--darkness that can be felt."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>"Just as you say," Moses replied, "I will never appear before you again."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the LORD had said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>(The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.)</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says: `About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt--worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, `Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will leave." Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The LORD had said to Moses, "Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you--so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for his family, one for each household.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire--head, legs and inner parts.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn--both men and animals--and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD--a lasting ordinance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat--that is all you may do.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel, whether he is an alien or native-born.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when your children ask you, `What does this ceremony mean to you?'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>then tell them, `It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-2" id="niv-verse-12-2">b</a>]</sup><span> was 430 years.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD's divisions left Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover: "No foreigner is to eat of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>"It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>"An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>The same law applies to the native-born and to the alien living among you." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Pharaoh will think, `The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." So the Israelites did this.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!"</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, `Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, `At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>This is what the LORD has commanded: `Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-1" id="niv-verse-16-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for each person you have in your tent.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much--two omers</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-2" id="niv-verse-16-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for each person--and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded: `Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-3" id="niv-verse-16-3">c</a>]</sup><span> refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The people of Israel called the bread manna.</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-4" id="niv-verse-16-4">d</a>]</sup><span> It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So they quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?"</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt--on the very day--they came to the Desert of Sinai.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>`You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, `Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on him. Whether man or animal, he shall not be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> trembled violently,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-3" id="niv-verse-19-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, `Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So Moses went down to the people and told them. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-1" id="niv-verse-32-1">a</a>]</sup><span> who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-2" id="niv-verse-32-2">b</a>]</sup><span> O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-3" id="niv-verse-32-3">c</a>]</sup><span> Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, `These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "O LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Why should the Egyptians say, `It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'?

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: `I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Moses replied: "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>They said to me, `Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So I told them, `Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But now, please forgive their sin--but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, `I will give it to your descendants.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way."</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out--until the day it lifted.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels. </span></div>
