<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness-- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"The multitude of your sacrifices-- what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations-- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her-- but now murderers!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled-- do not forgive them. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress. </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And they were calling to one another: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Say to him, `Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood--because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "`It will not take place, it will not happen,</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test."</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah, "`This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>You say you have strategy and military strength--but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God"--isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"`Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses--if you can put riders on them!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'" </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall--who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, `The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>until I come and take you to a land like your own--a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, `The LORD will deliver us.' Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, `This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard--those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-1" id="niv-verse-37-1">a</a>]</sup><span> king [of Egypt], was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, `Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them--the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-2" id="niv-verse-37-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: "The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, `With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>I have dug wells in foreign lands </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-3" id="niv-verse-37-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.' </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>"Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-4" id="niv-verse-37-4">d</a>]</sup><span> before it grows up. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>"But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>"This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah: "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>"Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: "He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city," declares the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>"I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning--there were all the dead bodies!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, "This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>I said, "I will not again see the LORD, the LORD, in the land of the living; no longer will I look on mankind, or be with those who now dwell in this world. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-38-2" id="niv-verse-38-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Like a shepherd's tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night you made an end of me.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 65</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>"I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said, `Here am I, here am I.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>who say, `Keep away; don't come near me, for I am too sacred for you!' Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"See, it stands written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>both your sins and the sins of your fathers," says the LORD. "Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>This is what the LORD says: "As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say, `Don't destroy it, there is yet some good in it,' so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen people will inherit them, and there will my servants live.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"But as for you who forsake the LORD and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I will destine you for the sword, and you will all bend down for the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse; the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth; he who fails to reach </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-65-1" id="niv-verse-65-1">a</a>]</sup><span> a hundred will be considered accursed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the LORD. </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 66</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>This is what the LORD says: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?" declares the LORD. "This is the one I esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man, and whoever offers a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig's blood, and whoever burns memorial incense, like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your brothers who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said, `Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet they will be put to shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies all they deserve. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?" says your God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For this is what the LORD says: "I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment upon all men, and many will be those slain by the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the midst of </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-66-1" id="niv-verse-66-1">a</a>]</sup><span> those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things--they will meet their end together," declares the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"And I, because of their actions and their imaginations, am about to come </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-66-2" id="niv-verse-66-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations--to Tarshish, to the Libyans </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-66-3" id="niv-verse-66-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD--on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels," says the LORD. "They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites," says the LORD. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me," declares the LORD, "so will your name and descendants endure.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the LORD.</span></div>
