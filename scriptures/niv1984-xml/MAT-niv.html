<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-966-26-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-968-26-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-969-26-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-970-26-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-987-26-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-988-26-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-991-26-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-992-26-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-3" id="niv-verse-26-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-994-26-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-995-26-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-997-26-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-998-26-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-999-26-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1000-26-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1001-26-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1003-26-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1004-26-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1005-26-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1006-26-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1007-26-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1009-26-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1010-26-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1011-26-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-4" id="niv-verse-26-4">d</a>]</sup><span> Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1012-26-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1017-26-56'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1018-26-57'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1019-26-58'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1020-26-59'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1024-26-63'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>But Jesus remained silent.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1025-26-64'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1026-26-65'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1027-26-66'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1028-26-67'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him</span></div>
