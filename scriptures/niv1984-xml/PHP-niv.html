<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and deacons: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I thank my God every time I remember you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Who, being in very nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but made himself nothing, taking the very nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of a servant, being made in human likeness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-- even death on a cross!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Do everything without complaining or arguing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>as you hold out </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the word of life--in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I have no one else like him, who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For everyone looks out for his own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</span></div>
