<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young--</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,</span></div>
