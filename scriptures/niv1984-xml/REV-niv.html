<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>who testifies to everything he saw--that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets (I will not impose any other burden on you):</span></div>
