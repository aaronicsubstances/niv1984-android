<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"The LORD was very angry with your forefathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore tell the people: This is what the LORD Almighty says: `Return to me,' declares the LORD Almighty, `and I will return to you,' says the LORD Almighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Do not be like your forefathers, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the LORD Almighty says: `Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.'

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your forefathers?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>During the night I had a vision--and there before me was a man riding a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.</span></div>
