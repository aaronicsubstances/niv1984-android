    <verse num="5">
      <content>In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>But they had no children because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.</content>

      <content>While Zechariah was serving as a priest before God when his division was on duty,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>At the hour of incense the whole multitude of the people was praying outside.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled, and fear fell upon him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for yoʋr prayer has been heard. Yoʋr wife Elizabeth will bear yoʋ a son, and yoʋ shall name him John.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Yoʋ will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</content>

      <content>He will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And he will go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this for certain? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in her days.”</content>
    </verse>

      <content>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God and was sent to speak to yoʋ and bring yoʋ this good news.</content>

      <content>But behold, yoʋ will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because yoʋ did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their appointed time.”</content>
