      <content>He was in the beginning with God.</content>

      <content>There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.</content>

      <content>He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.</content>

      <content>The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.</content>

      <content>The Identity of John the Baptist</content>

      <content>This was the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are yoʋ?”</content>

      <content>He did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”</content>
    </verse>

      <content>So they asked him, “What then? Are yoʋ Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are yoʋ the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”</content>
    </verse>

      <content>So they said to him, “Who are yoʋ? Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do yoʋ say about yoʋrself?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>(Now those who had been sent were from the Pharisees.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Then they asked him, “Why then do yoʋ baptize if yoʋ are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained upon him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>I myself did not recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He upon whom yoʋ see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</content>

      <content>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Jesus was also invited to the wedding, and so were his disciples.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, “They have no wine.”</content>

    <verse num="4">
      <content>Jesus said to her, “Woman, what concern is that to yoʋ or to me? My hour has not yet come.”</content>

      <content>But his mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.</content>

      <content>Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.</content>

      <content>Then he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and the master of the feast tasted the water, which had been turned into wine. He did not know where it had come from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then the master of the feast called the bridegroom aside</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have drunk freely; but yoʋ have kept the good wine until now.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the first of his signs. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</content>

      <content>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>In the temple courts he found those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and he also found the money changers sitting at their tables.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, along with their sheep and oxen. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Then he said to those who were selling doves, “Take these things away from here; do not make my Father's house a house of trade.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And his disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for yoʋr house will consume me.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>In response the Jews said to him, “What sign can yoʋ show us to prove yoʋr authority to do these things?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</content>

      <content>The Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will yoʋ raise it up in three days?”</content>

    <verse num="21">
      <content>But he was speaking about the temple of his body.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that yoʋ are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can do these signs that yoʋ are doing unless God is with him.”</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to yoʋ, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Nicodemus said to him, “How can a person be born when he is old? Can he enter the womb of his mother a second time and be born?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to yoʋ, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>Do not be amazed that I said to yoʋ, ‘You must be born again.’</content>

      <content>The wind blows where it wishes. Yoʋ hear the sound of it, but yoʋ do not know where it is coming from or where it is going; so it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>In response Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Jesus answered him, “Yoʋ are the teacher of Israel, and yoʋ do not understand these things?</content>

      <content>Truly, truly, I say to yoʋ, we speak of what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.</content>

      <content>so that everyone who believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</content>
    </verse>

    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>This is the judgment: The light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.</content>
