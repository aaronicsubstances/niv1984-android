      <content>The first account I compiled, O Theophilus, was about all that Jesus began to do and teach</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>He presented himself alive to them, after his suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over the course of forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>While he was with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, Which,” he said, you heard about from me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</content>

      <content>So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, are yoʋ going to restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>He said to them, It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>After he said this, he was lifted up as they looked on, and a cloud took him out of their sight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>As he went, they were gazing up into the sky, when behold, two men in white clothing were standing beside them.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>They said, “Men of Galilee, why are you standing here staring into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”</content>

      <content>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>After entering the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>With one accord they were all devoting themselves to prayer and supplication, along with Jesus' brothers and several women, including Mary the mother of Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>In those days Peter stood up among the disciples (a crowd of about one hundred twenty people who were gathered together). He said,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>“Brothers, it was necessary for this Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For he was numbered with us and received his share in this ministry.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>(Now this man Judas had acquired a field with the wages of unrighteousness, and falling headfirst, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>This became known to all who were dwelling in Jerusalem, so that in their language the field was called Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Peter continued, “For it is written in the Book of Psalms: ‘May his homestead become desolate; let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and, ‘May another take his position as overseer.’</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Therefore, one of the men who have accompanied us during the entire time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>beginning from the baptism of John up to the day when Jesus was taken up from us, must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas (who was given the name Justus), and Matthias.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Then they prayed, “Lord, yoʋ know the hearts of all; show us which of these two men yoʋ have chosen</content>

      <content>to receive the share of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.”</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>When the day of Pentecost came, all the believers were in the same place with one accord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Divided tongues that looked like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven dwelling in Jerusalem.</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>They were all astonished and amazed, saying to one another, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</content>

      <content>How then do we each hear them in our own native languages?</content>

      <content>They were all amazed and greatly perplexed, saying to one another, “What could this mean?”</content>

      <content>Peter's Sermon at Pentecost</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Then Peter stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and declared to them, “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>These men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>‘In the last days, says God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Even upon my male and female servants I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>I will perform wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below: blood, fire, and a mist of smoke.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>“Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves well know,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>this man, who was delivered up by the deliberate plan and foreknowledge of God, you took and put to death, having him nailed to the cross by the hands of lawless men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But God raised him up, releasing him from the pangs of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">

      <content>“Brothers, I can say to you with confidence concerning our patriarch David that he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</content>

    <verse num="30">
      <content>So then, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn an oath to him that from among his descendants, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>David foresaw what would happen and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, saying that his soul was not abandoned to Hades and that his flesh did not see corruption.</content>

    <verse num="32">
      <content>This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you now see and hear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>For David did not ascend to heaven, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand</content>

    <verse num="37">
      <content>When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”</content>

    <verse num="38">
      <content>Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</content>

      <content>For this promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.”</content>

      <content>With many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation.”</content>

      <content>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized, and about three thousand souls were added on that day.</content>

      <content>One day Peter and John were going up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.</content>

      <content>And a man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried in. Every day people would lay him at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those who were entering the temple courts.</content>
