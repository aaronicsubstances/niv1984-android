      <content>First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that I continually remember you,</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>always pleading in my prayers that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>that is, that while I am among you we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but have been hindered until the present time) so that I might have some fruit among you as well, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish;</content>

      <content>The Power of the Gospel</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, both to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”</content>

      <content>God's Wrath Against Unrighteousness</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Because what is known about God is evident among them, for God has made it evident to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For his invisible qualities, both his everlasting power and his divinity, have been plainly seen from the creation of the world, being perceived through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their thoughts, and their senseless hearts were darkened.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Claiming to be wise, they became fools</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>because they exchanged the truth of God for falsehood and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions, for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is contrary to nature.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>In the same way the men also, having abandoned the natural function of the female, were inflamed in their lust for one another, men committing shameful acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And just as they considered it worthless to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a worthless mind, to do what is not proper.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>They are filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, evil, covetousness, and malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and maliciousness. They are gossips,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>senseless, untrustworthy, without natural affection, irreconcilable, and unmerciful.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Though they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things deserve death, they not only do them but also approve of those who practice them.</content>

      <content>The Righteous Judgment of God</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Therefore yoʋ are without excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For on whatever grounds yoʋ judge another, yoʋ condemn yoʋrself, for yoʋ who judge do the same things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Now we know that the judgment of God against those who do such things is in accordance with truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Do yoʋ suppose, O man—yoʋ who judge those who do such things and yet do them yoʋrself—that yoʋ will escape the judgment of God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Or do yoʋ despise the riches of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads yoʋ to repentance?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But according to yoʋr stubbornness and yoʋr unrepentant heart, yoʋ are storing up wrath for yoʋrself on the day of wrath, revelation, and the righteous judgment of God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>who will repay each person according to his works.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>To those who by patient endurance in good works seek glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>but for those who are self-seeking and obey unrighteousness instead of the truth, there will be anger and wrath.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>There will be tribulation and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>but there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For there is no partiality with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what is required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness with them and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secret thoughts of men through Jesus Christ.</content>

      <content>The Jews and the Law</content>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>Behold, yoʋ call yoʋrself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Yoʋ know his will and approve what is excellent, because yoʋ are instructed from the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And yoʋ have confidence that yoʋ yoʋrself are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in darkness,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>an instructor of the foolish, and a teacher of children, because yoʋ have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Yoʋ then who teach others, do yoʋ not teach yoʋrself? Yoʋ who preach against stealing, do yoʋ steal?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Yoʋ who tell others not to commit adultery, do yoʋ commit adultery? Yoʋ who abhor idols, do yoʋ rob temples?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Yoʋ who boast in the law, do yoʋ dishonor God by transgressing the law?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>As it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Circumcision does indeed benefit yoʋ if yoʋ observe the law, but if yoʋ transgress the law, yoʋr circumcision has become uncircumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>If then an uncircumcised man keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Then he who is physically uncircumcised and carries out the law will judge yoʋ who, despite having the letter of the law and circumcision, transgress the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is circumcision something outward in the flesh;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. Such a man's praise comes not from men but from God.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>What then is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Much in every way. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Now what if some of them were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify the faithfulness of God?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Certainly not! Rather, let God be true even if every man is a liar, just as it is written, “So that yoʋ may be justified in yoʋr words, and prevail when yoʋ are judged.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God, who inflicts wrath, unrighteous? (I speak in a human way.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Certainly not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For if through my lie the truth of God abounds to his glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And why not say (just as some slanderously claim that we say), “Let us do evil that good may come”? Their condemnation is just.</content>

      <content>No One is Righteous</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>What then? Are we Jews any better off? Not at all! For we have previously charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>just as it is written, “There is none righteous, not even one;</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in his sight, for through the law comes knowledge of sin.</content>

      <content>Justification by Faith</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from the law, attested by the Law and the Prophets,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all and upon all who believe; for there is no distinction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>being freely justified by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith, by his blood. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins that had previously been committed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>He did so to prove in the present time that he is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>We conclude therefore that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles also? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>since God is one, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Do we then nullify the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</content>

      <content>The Example of Abraham</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>What then shall we say that Abraham our father has discovered according to the flesh?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but as something owed to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>However, to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>just as David also speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Blessed is the man against whom the Lord will never count sin.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Is this blessedness then only for the circumcised, or is it also for the uncircumcised? For we say, “Faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>How then was it counted? When he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not when he was circumcised, but when he was uncircumcised.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe when they are uncircumcised, so that righteousness might be counted to them as well,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>and so that he might be the father of those who are not only circumcised in the flesh, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had when he was uncircumcised.</content>

      <content>The Promise Granted Through Faith</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For the promise to Abraham, or to his offspring, that he would be the heir of the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith has been made void and the promise has been invalidated,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>because the law brings wrath; for where there is no law, there is no transgression.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For this reason the promise comes by faith, so that it may be according to grace and be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring, not only to the one who is of the law, but also to the one who is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>(just as it is written, “I have made yoʋ the father of many nations”). He is our father in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Against all hope Abraham believed in hope that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been spoken: “So shall yoʋr offspring be.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Because he was not weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, now as good as dead (since he was somewhere around a hundred years old), or the deadness of Sarah's womb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>and being fully assured that God was able to do what he had promised.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Therefore, “it was counted to him as righteousness.”</content>
    </verse>

    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But the righteousness that is by faith speaks like this: “Do not say in yoʋr heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>“or, ‘Who will go down into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But what does it say? “The word is near yoʋ, in yoʋr mouth and in yoʋr heart” (that is, the word of faith that we preach),</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>because if yoʋ confess with yoʋr mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe with yoʋr heart that God raised him from the dead, yoʋ will be saved.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For with the heart belief is exercised, resulting in righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made, resulting in salvation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>As the Scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call upon him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without someone preaching?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who preach good news of good things!”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But not all the Israelites have obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing comes through the word of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But I ask, have they not heard? On the contrary, “The message has gone out into all the earth, and the words to the ends of the world.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a nation that has no understanding I will provoke you to anger.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Isaiah is even bold enough to say, “I was found by those who were not seeking me; I became known to those who were not asking for me.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>But to Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”</content>

      <content>I ask then, has God rejected his people? Certainly not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>But I have written to you rather boldly in part, brothers, by way of reminder, because of the grace that was given to me by God</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>to be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an acceptable offering, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Therefore I have a reason for boasting in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For I will not dare to speak of anything other than what Christ has accomplished through me to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And in this way I aspire to preach the gospel where the name of Christ has not been heard, so that I do not build upon another's foundation,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>but as it is written, “Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”</content>

      <content>For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>They were pleased to do so, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in the spiritual blessings of the Jews, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.</content>
