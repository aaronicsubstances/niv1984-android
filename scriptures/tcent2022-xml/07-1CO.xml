    <verse num="2">
      <content>to the church of God in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be saints, together with all who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For you have been enriched in him in every way, in all speech and all knowledge,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>so that you are not lacking in any gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

      <content>He will strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be knit together in the same mind and in the same purpose.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For it has been disclosed to me about you, my brothers, by those of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels among you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul,” while another says, “I follow Apollos,” or, “I follow Cephas,” or, “I follow Christ.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>so that no one may say that I baptized into my own name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not recall if I baptized anyone else.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, and not with cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be deprived of its power.</content>

      <content>Christ the Power and Wisdom of God</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will nullify.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made the wisdom of this world foolish?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of our proclamation to save those who believe.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Consider your calling, brothers, that not many of you were wise according to the flesh, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>God chose what is lowly and despised in the world, things that are regarded as nothing, to nullify the things that are regarded as something,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>so that no flesh might boast before God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God, and in whom we have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</content>

      <content>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>And my word and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</content>

      <content>Spiritual Wisdom</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now we speak wisdom among the mature, but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>On the contrary, we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God foreordained for our glory before time began.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>None of the rulers of this age understood this wisdom, for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But, as it is written, “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no heart has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might understand what God has freely given us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>We speak about this, not with words taught by human wisdom but with words taught by the Holy Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>The natural man does not accept what comes from the Spirit of God, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it because it is spiritually discerned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But he who is spiritual makes judgments about all things, and yet he himself is not subject to any man's judgment.</content>

      <content>Division Is of the Flesh</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And so, brothers, I could not address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as infants in Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. Even now you are still not able,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>for you are still of the flesh. For where there is jealousy, strife, and division among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving like mere men?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another says, “I follow Apollos,” are you not of the flesh?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So then, neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but only God who gives the growth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For we are fellow workers of God; you are God's field, God's building.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>According to the grace of God given to me, like a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But each person must be careful how he builds upon it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>If anyone builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>his work will become evident, for the Day will make it clear, because it is revealed by fire. And the fire will test each person's work and reveal what sort of work it is.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>If the work that anyone has built remains, he will receive a reward.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; yet he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which is what you are.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become foolish so that he may become truly wise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. As it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>So then, let no one boast in men. For everything belongs to you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life or death, or things present or things to come—everything belongs to you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</content>

      <content>The Ministry of the Apostles</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>People ought to regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Now it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But for me it is a very small thing if I am judged by you, or by any human court. Indeed, I do not even judge myself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not thereby acquitted; but he who judges me is the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So then, do not judge anything before the appointed time. Wait until the Lord comes, who will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the heart. At that time each person will receive his praise from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your sake, so that through us you may learn not to think beyond what is written, so that you may not be puffed up, with each one of you supporting one man against another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For who regards yoʋ as superior? What do yoʋ have that yoʋ did not receive? And if yoʋ received it, why do yoʋ boast as though yoʋ did not receive it?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>You are already full! You have already become rich! You have begun to reign without us! And how I wish that you really were reigning, so that we could reign with you!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For I think that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, as sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are esteemed, but we are dishonored.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>To the present hour we hunger and thirst; we are poorly clothed and beaten down, with no home of our own.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>We labor, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the scum of all things, even to this present time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I am not writing this to shame you, but rather I am admonishing you as my beloved children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you would not have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I became a father to you through the gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Therefore I urge you to be imitators of me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>That is why I have sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them everywhere in every church.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But some of you have become puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of those who have become puffed up, but their power.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not by talk but by power.</content>
    </verse>
