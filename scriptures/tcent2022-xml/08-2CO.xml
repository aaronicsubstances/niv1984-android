      <content>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we can comfort those experiencing any kind of affliction with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, which helps you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. And our hope for you is steadfast. If we are comforted, it is also for your comfort and salvation,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But this happened so that we would not rely on ourselves, but on God, who raises the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>He rescued us from such a terrible death, and continues to rescue us. We have put our hope in him that he will rescue us yet again</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>as you join in helping us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on your behalf for the favor granted to us through the prayers of many.</content>

      <content>Paul's Change of Plans</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now this is the reason for our confidence: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with integrity and godly sincerity, not by worldly wisdom, but by the grace of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For we are not writing anything to you other than what you can read and understand. And I hope that you will understand completely—</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>just as you have understood us in part—that on the day of the Lord Jesus you will be proud of us just as we will be proud of you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Because I was confident of this, I intended to come to you first, so that you would be blessed by a second visit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and return to you from Macedonia, and then have you send me on my way to Judea.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Was I vacillating when I planned to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner, ready to say “Yes” and “No” at the same time?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you did not waver between “Yes” and “No.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom Silvanus, Timothy, and I preached among you, did not waver between “Yes” and “No.” On the contrary, in him God's answer has always been “Yes.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For in him every one of God's promises is “Yes,” and in him we say “Amen” to the glory of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and who anointed us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>He has also sealed us and put his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But I call upon God as a witness against me, that the reason I did not return to Corinth was to spare you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Not that we rule over your faith; rather, we work with you for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.</content>
    </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>So I made up my mind that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if I make you sorrowful, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have made sorrowful?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>That is why I wrote to you as I did, so that when I came I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence about you all that my joy would be yours.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you sorrow, but to let you know the abundant love I have for you.</content>

      <content>Forgive the Sinner</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Now if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure (not to put it too severely) to all of you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>This punishment by the majority is enough for that person.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So you should forgive and comfort him instead, so that he will not be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>I wrote to you because I wanted to test your character and see if you would be obedient in everything.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now if you forgive anyone of anything, I also forgive him. For if I have forgiven anyone of anything, I have done it for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>so that we might not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his schemes.</content>

      <content>Triumph in Christ</content>

    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus. So I took leave of the people there and went on to Macedonia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ everywhere.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For we are a sweet fragrance of Christ ascending to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>to the latter we are a smell of death leading to death, but to the former we are a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is equal to such a task?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For we are not like others who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak with sincerity in the presence of God, as men sent from God.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or letters of recommendation from you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>You are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on tablets of human hearts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Such is the confidence that we have in God through Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Not that we are competent in and of ourselves to claim that anything comes from us, but our competence comes from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now if the ministry of death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory (a glory that was fading away),</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory even more.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For what was once glorious now has no glory in comparison with the glory that surpasses it.</content>

      <content>And if what was fading away came with glory, what remains will be even more glorious.</content>

      <content>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we act with great boldness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not gaze at the end of what was fading away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read. Only in Christ is this veil taken away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</content>

      <content>Therefore, since we have this ministry through God's mercy, we do not lose heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Rather, we have renounced shameful hidden deeds; we do not act deceitfully or distort the word of God, but by openly proclaiming the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing.</content>

      <content>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers like them, so that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not dawn upon them.</content>

      <content>For what we preach is not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</content>

    </verse>

      <content>For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>Therefore, because we know what it is to fear the Lord, we persuade others. What we are is known to God, and I hope that it is known in your consciences as well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearances and not about matters of the heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>For the love of Christ compels us, because we have concluded that if one died for all, then all have died.</content>

      <content>And he died for all so that those who live may no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, we no longer know him in that way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>And all these things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,</content>

      <content>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us. We plead on Christ's behalf: “Be reconciled to God.”</content>

      <content>Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>During a severe trial of affliction, their abundant joy and their deep poverty abounded in a wealth of generosity on their part.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>urgently begging us for the privilege of contributing to the gift for the saints in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And they did not do this in the way we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us by the will of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>So we have urged Titus, who previously encouraged you to begin gathering money, to return and help you complete this gracious gift.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But just as you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in your love for us—make sure you abound in this gracious gift as well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>I am not saying this as a command, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you could become rich.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>So I am giving my advice about what is best for you in this matter. Last year you were not only the first who wanted to give, but you were also the first to begin doing so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now finish doing it, so that your eager willingness to give may be matched by your completion of the gift, according to what you have.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For if the eager willingness is there, it is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>I do not mean there should be relief for others and hardship for you, but it is a matter of equality. At the present time your abundance should provide for their need,</content>

      <content>There is no need for me to write to you about this ministry of giving to the saints in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For I know how eager you are to help, and I keep boasting about you to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been prepared to give since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter may not prove to be empty, but that you may be prepared, just as I said you would be.</content>

      <content>Otherwise, if any of the Macedonians were to come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you) would be ashamed of this confident boasting.</content>

      <content>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance your previously announced blessing, so that this gift of yours may be ready as a blessing and not as something you feel forced to do.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>We, however, will not boast beyond certain limits, but will confine our boasting to the area of ministry that God has assigned to us, which reaches even as far as you.</content>
