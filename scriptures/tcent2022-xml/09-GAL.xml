      <content>But I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel I preached did not originate with man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, being far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But when God, who set me apart before I was born and called me by his grace, was pleased</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach good news about him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.</content>

      <content>(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)</content>

      <content>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>They were only hearing people say, “The man who once persecuted us is now preaching the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>So they were glorifying God because of me.</content>

      <content>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I went up in response to a revelation and presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were held in high esteem, to make sure that I was not running or had not run in vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he is a Greek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now this matter arose because of the false brothers who were secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But we did not yield to them in submission for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now from those who were esteemed to be something (what sort of men they once were makes no difference to me; God does not show partiality)—those, I say, who were held in high esteem added nothing to me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For he who worked through Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised also worked through me in my apostleship to the Gentiles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>When James, Cephas, and John, who were esteemed as pillars of the church, recognized the grace given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and that they should go to the circumcised.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For he regularly ate with the Gentiles until certain men came from James. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself because he was afraid of the circumcision faction.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But if we ourselves have also been found to be sinners while seeking to be justified in Christ, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not!</content>

      <content>Law or Faith</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you to keep you from obeying the truth? In your presence, before your very eyes, Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be perfected by the flesh?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Did you suffer so much in vain?—if indeed it was in vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you perform the works of the law or because you hear with faith?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Remember, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Therefore you must understand that those who have faith are the sons of Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Now the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the nations will be blessed in yoʋ.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So then, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, because “the righteous will live by faith.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>But the law is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The person who does these things will live by them.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</content>

      <content>The Law and the Promise</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Brothers, let me give an example from everyday life: When a man-made covenant is ratified, no one annuls it or adds to it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “And to his descendants,” referring to many, but referring to one man it says, “And to yoʋr descendant,” who is Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>My point is this: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul a covenant previously ratified by God to Christ, so as to invalidate the promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by the promise; but God granted it to Abraham by a promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom the promise had been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now a mediator does not represent just one party, but God is one.</content>
    </verse>
    <fragment kind="HEADING">
      <content>Slaves and Sons</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, truly righteousness would have come through the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise might be given on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Now before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined until the faith that was to come would be revealed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>The law, then, was our guardian until Christ came, so that we could be justified by faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants and heirs according to the promise.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the master of all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>But he is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by his father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>In the same way also, when we were children, we were enslaved to the elements of the world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>But when the fullness of time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba! Father!”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So yoʋ are no longer a slave, but a son. And if yoʋ are a son, yoʋ are also an heir of God through Christ.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And you did not despise or reject me even though my physical condition was a trial for me. On the contrary, you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>What then has become of that sense of blessing you had? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.</content>

      <content>The Allegory of Hagar and Sarah</content>

    <verse num="21">
      <content>Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But the son of the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through the promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>This can be explained allegorically, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem; she is in slavery with her children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>But the Jerusalem that is above is the free woman; she is the mother of us all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren woman, who has never given birth; break forth and shout, yoʋ who have never been in labor! For many are the children of the desolate woman, more than those of the woman who has a husband.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Now we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of the promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>But just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”</content>
