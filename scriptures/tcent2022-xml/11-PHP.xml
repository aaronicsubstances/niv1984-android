    <verse num="3">
      <content>I give thanks to my God every time I remember you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>always praying with joy in every one of my prayers for you all</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>because of your partnership with me in the gospel from the first day until now.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>I am confident that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>It is right for me to think this way about you all, since I have you in my heart. For you all share with me in God's grace, both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For God is my witness that I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And I pray that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>so that you may approve what is excellent in order to be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</content>

      <content>Paul's Imprisonment Advances the Gospel</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually helped advance the gospel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>so that it has become known among the entire imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And the greater part of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence through my imprisonment and are far more bold to speak the word without fear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others do it out of good will.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to add affliction to me in my imprisonment.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But what does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>My eager expectation and hope is that I will not be put to shame in anything, but will speak with complete boldness so that now, as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether I live or die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But if I am to live in the flesh, it will mean fruit from my labor. Yet I do not know which I prefer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>I am hard pressed between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>so that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus because of me when I come to you again.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Only live as citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>and not being intimidated in any way by those who oppose you. For them this is an indication of destruction, but for you it is an indication of salvation, and that from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>since you are experiencing the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</content>

      <content>Imitating Christ's Humility</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort from love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion or mercy,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>make my joy complete by adopting the same mindset, having the same love, being united in spirit, and having one purpose.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Do nothing from selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility regard others as more important than yourselves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>None of you should look out for your own interests, but for the interests of others.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>who, though he was in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be exploited,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant and being born in the likeness of men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Therefore God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every other name,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</content>

      <content>Therefore, my beloved friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>for God is the one at work in you, granting you the will and power to do so, according to his good pleasure.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Do everything without grumbling or arguing,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>as you hold firmly to the word of life. Then I will have a reason to boast in the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>In the same way you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</content>

      <content>Timothy and Epaphroditus</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I too may be encouraged when I receive news about you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>I have no one else like-minded who will be genuinely concerned about your welfare.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For they all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But you know Timothy's proven character, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Therefore I hope to send him to you at once, as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But for now I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For he has been longing for you all and was distressed because you heard that he was sick.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Indeed he was sick, almost to the point of death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be less anxious.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor men like him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>because he drew near to death for the work of Christ, disregarding his own life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those who mutilate the flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For we are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>even though I myself might put confidence in the flesh. If anyone else presumes to have confidence in the flesh, I have more:</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;</content>

      <content>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But whatever was gain to me I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>More than that, I count all things as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish so that I may gain Christ</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, which comes from God on the basis of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</content>

      <content>Not that I have already obtained it or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus has taken hold of me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>I press on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Therefore all of us who are mature should adopt this mindset, and if you adopt a different mindset about anything, God will reveal that to you as well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Nevertheless, let us live up to the same standard that we have already attained; let us adopt the same mindset.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who walk according to the example you have in us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For I have often told you, and tell you now with tears, that many walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await from there a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</content>
