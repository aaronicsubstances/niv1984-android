      <content>the faith and love that spring from the hope that is laid up for you in heaven. You have already heard about this hope in the message of the truth of the gospel</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf</content>

    <verse num="14">
      <content>in whom we have redemption, the remission of sins.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in everything he may be preeminent.</content>

    <verse num="23">
      <content>if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, without shifting away from the hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has been preached in all creation under heaven, and of this gospel I, Paul, have become a servant.</content>

    <verse num="24">
      <content>I rejoice now in my sufferings for you, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>I became a servant of the church according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>the mystery that has been hidden for ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>To them God resolved to make known how great among the Gentiles are the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</content>

    <verse num="28">
      <content>He is the one we proclaim, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>To this end I labor, striving according to his energy that is powerfully at work within me.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me face to face.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I want their hearts to be comforted and knit together in love, so that they may have all the riches of being fully assured in their understanding, and so that they may know the mystery of our God and Father and of Christ,</content>

      <content>in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>I say this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive speech.</content>

    <verse num="6">
      <content>Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to walk in him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>being rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For all the fullness of God's nature dwells bodily in Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>and you have been filled by him, who is the head over every ruler and authority.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not done by hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Having been buried with him in baptism, you have also been raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And although you were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with Christ. He forgave us all our trespasses</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>by blotting out the certificate of debt that stood against us with its legal demands; he took it away by nailing it to the cross.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>He stripped the rulers and authorities of their power and made a public display of them, leading a triumphal procession over them by the cross.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Therefore let no one judge you in regard to food or drink, or in the matter of a feast, a New Moon celebration, or a Sabbath day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance is Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Let no one who delights in false humility and angelic religion disqualify you. Such a person takes his stand on things he has not seen, being puffed up without reason by the mind of his flesh,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>while not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supported and knit together by its joints and tendons, grows with a growth that is from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>If you have died with Christ to the elements of the world, why, as though you were living in the world, do you submit to regulations such as,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch”?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Such regulations are based on the commandments and doctrines of men, and apply to things that will all decay with use.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Although these regulations have a semblance of wisdom in self-imposed piety, false humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are of no value in restraining fleshly indulgence.</content>

      <content>If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</content>

      <content>Set your minds on the things above, not the things on earth.</content>

      <content>You too once walked in these ways when you lived among them.</content>

      <content>But now you must put them all aside: wrath, anger, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices</content>

    <verse num="10">
      <content>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its Creator.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Here there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free, but Christ is all and in all.</content>

    <verse num="12">
      <content>Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and beloved, put on tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,</content>

      <content>bearing with one another and forgiving one other if any one of you has a complaint against another; just as Christ forgave you, so you also must forgive.</content>

      <content>Above all, put on love, which is the bond of perfection.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to the Lord with gratitude in your hearts.</content>

      <content>And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to our God and Father through him.</content>
