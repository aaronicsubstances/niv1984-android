    <verse num="3">
      <content>We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly increasing and the love that each of you has for one another is abounding.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and tribulations that you are enduring.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, and it is happening so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>It is indeed right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>and to give to you who are being afflicted relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>With flaming fire he will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">

      <content>The Man of Sin</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>not to be quickly shaken from your understanding or alarmed by the spirit or by any message or letter supposedly from us alleging that the day of Christ has already come.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Let no one deceive you in any manner, for that day cannot come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>He will oppose and exalt himself above every so-called god and object of worship, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And you know what is now restraining him so that he will be revealed in his own time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but the one who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth and annihilate by the appearance of his coming.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the working of Satan, with all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs, and wonders,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>and with every kind of wicked deception among those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For this reason God will send them a powerful delusion, leading them to believe what is false,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>so that all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned.</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So then, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings that were passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by a letter from us.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by his grace,</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And pray that we may be rescued from deviant and evil men, for not all have faith.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>But the Lord is faithful; he will establish you and guard you from the evil one.</content>

      <content>Warning Against Idleness</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every brother who walks in idleness and does not live according to the teaching we passed on to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>nor did we eat bread from anyone free of charge. On the contrary, with labor and hardship we worked day and night so as not to be a burden to any of you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>We did this, not because we do not have the right to be supported, but to present ourselves as an example for you to imitate.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: “If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For we hear that some among you are walking in idleness, not working at all, but being busybodies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now we command and exhort such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of him and do not associate with him, so that he will feel ashamed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</content>

      <content>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the distinguishing mark in all my letters; it is the way I write.</content>
