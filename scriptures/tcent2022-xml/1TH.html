<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-h'><span>The Thessalonians' Good Example</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We always give thanks to God for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>remembering without ceasing, in the presence of our God and Father, your work of faith, your labor of love, and your endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For we know, brothers beloved by God, that you have been chosen,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with much conviction. You know what sort of men we proved to be among you for your sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord when you received the word in much affliction with the joy of the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>As a result you have become examples to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but reports of your faith in God have gone out everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything about it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For the people themselves report what kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned away from idols to serve the living and true God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>as you wait for his Son Jesus to return from heaven, whom God raised from the dead, and who rescues us from the coming wrath.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>On the contrary, even though we had previously suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the face of strong opposition.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or with deceit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who examines our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>God is our witness that we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed, as you well know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Nor did we seek glory from men (neither from you nor from others), though as Christ's apostles we could have asserted our authority.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother caring for her children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We had such strong affection for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become dear to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship. Working night and day so as not to be a burden on any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You are witnesses, and so is God, of how devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly we conducted ourselves among you who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father deals with his own children, exhorting you, encouraging you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and testifying that you should walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>We also give thanks to God without ceasing because, when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you suffered the same things from your own countrymen that they did from the Jews,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>who killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and who also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>by hindering us from telling the Gentiles how they can be saved. In this way they are always filling up the measure of their sins, but wrath has come upon them at last.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-h'><span>Paul's Longing to See the Thessalonians</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>As for us, brothers, when we were bereaved of you for a brief hour (being physically absent, but with you in our hearts), we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-35-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, tried to do so again and again—but Satan hindered us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-36-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-37-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Yes, you are our glory and joy!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-40-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, when we could bear it no longer, we thought it best to stay in Athens alone,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-41-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and we sent Timothy, our brother, who is a servant of God and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you in your faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-42-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we have been appointed to afflictions such as these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-43-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>In fact, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction, and as you well know, it has now happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-44-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor had been in vain.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-46-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Timothy has now come back to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, brothers, in all our affliction and distress, we were encouraged about you because of your faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-49-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-50-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Night and day we pray earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-57-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Finally, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus that, just as you learned from us how you ought to walk and to please God, you do so more and more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-58-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For you know the commands we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-59-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>It is God's will that you be sanctified, that you abstain from fornication,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-61-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-62-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>In this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of his brother, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you before and solemnly warned you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-63-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For God did not call us to be impure, but to live in holiness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-64-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore whoever rejects this command does not reject man but God, who has given his Holy Spirit to you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-66-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And indeed you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do so more and more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-67-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>We urge you to aspire to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own affairs, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-71-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-72-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>According to the word of the Lord, we declare to you that we who are alive, who are left behind until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-73-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-74-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then we who are alive, who are left behind, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.</span></div>
