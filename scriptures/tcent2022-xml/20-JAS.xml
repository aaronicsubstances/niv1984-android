      <content>The Testing of Your Faith Produces Endurance</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Count it all joy, my brothers, when you experience various trials,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But he must ask in faith without doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed about.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>The lowly brother should rejoice in being exalted,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>and the rich man should rejoice in being made low, because he will pass away like a flower of grass.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.</content>

      <content>Enduring Temptation</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>No one should say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God is not tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. And when sin is fully grown, it brings forth death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Of his own will he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</content>

      <content>Hearing and Abiding by the Word</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>So then, my beloved brothers, everyone should be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and rampant wickedness, humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But be doers of the word and not hearers only. Otherwise, you are deceiving yourselves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For he looks at himself and goes away, and then immediately forgets what he looks like.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts. He will be blessed in what he does.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>If anyone among you considers himself to be religious but does not bridle his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Pure and undefiled religion before God our Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</content>

      <content>Warning Against Partiality</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="1">
      <content>My brothers, practice your faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, without showing partiality.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Suppose a man in fine clothing comes into your assembly wearing a gold ring, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>If you pay attention to the man who is wearing fine clothing and say to him, “Yoʋ sit here in a good place,” but you say to the poor man, “Yoʋ stand there, or sit here under my footstool,”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen the poor of the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Are they not the ones who drag you into court?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Do they not blaspheme the good name by which you are called?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “Yoʋ shall love yoʋr neighbor as yoʋrself,” you do well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For whoever keeps the entire law but stumbles in one point has become guilty of it all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if yoʋ do not commit adultery but do commit murder, yoʋ have become a transgressor of the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For judgment is without mercy to anyone who has not shown mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</content>

      <content>Faith and Works</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>What is the benefit, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacks daily food,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them anything to address their physical needs, what is the benefit?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>In the same way faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But someone will say, “Yoʋ have faith, and I have works.” Show me yoʋr faith by yoʋr works, and I, by my works, will show yoʋ my faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Yoʋ believe that God is one; yoʋ do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Do yoʋ want to be shown, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Was not our father Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Do yoʋ see how faith was active along with his works, and by works his faith was brought to completion?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>You see then that a person is justified by works, and not by faith alone.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.</content>

      <content>Taming the Tongue</content>

      <content>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his entire body as well.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>In the same way, the tongue is a small member, yet it makes great boasts. Consider how great a forest a little fire kindles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of unrighteousness, staining the entire body, setting the course of life on fire, and itself being set on fire by hell.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Every species of beast, bird, reptile, and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by man,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>but no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>With it we bless God our Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in God's likeness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this ought not to be so.</content>

      <content>Does a spring pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening?</content>

      <content>Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a grapevine figs? In the same way, no spring can produce both salt water and fresh water.</content>

      <content>The Wisdom from Above</content>

      <content>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.</content>

      <content>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above; rather, it is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.</content>

      <content>For where there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice.</content>
