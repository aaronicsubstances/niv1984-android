    <verse num="3">
      <content>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you,</content>

    <verse num="5">
      <content>who by the power of God are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>so that the proven character of your faith—far more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire—may result in praise, honor, and glory when Jesus Christ is revealed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Although you once did not know him, you love him; although you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with an unspeakable and glorious joy,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>because you are receiving the end result of your faith—the salvation of your souls.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that would come to you searched and carefully investigated,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>inquiring about the time and circumstances that the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he testified in advance to the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in regard to the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to catch a glimpse of these things.</content>

      <content>Be Holy</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>As children of obedience, do not conform yourselves to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But just as he who called you is holy, you also must be holy in all your conduct,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>for it is written, “Be holy, because I am holy.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>If you call on the Father who judges without partiality according to each person's work, pass the time of your sojourn in reverent fear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For you know that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in the last times for your sake.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth through the Spirit, resulting in genuine brotherly love, love one another deeply, from a pure heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the word of God that lives and abides forever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For, “All flesh is like grass, and all the glory of man is like a flower of grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>but the word of the Lord endures forever.” This word is the good news that was preached to you.</content>

      <content>So put aside all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Like newborn babies, long for pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation,</content>

      <content>if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and precious in the sight of God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>you yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For it says in Scripture, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and no one who believes in him will ever be put to shame.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>This precious value is for you who believe, but to those who are disobedient, “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>and, “A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.” By disobeying the word they stumble, which is what they were appointed to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But you are a chosen lineage, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</content>

      <content>Beloved, I urge you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>keeping your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God on the day of his visitation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Therefore, be subject to every human institution for the sake of the Lord, whether to the king as supreme,</content>

      <content>or to governors as those who are sent by him to punish evildoers and to praise those who do good.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>The Example of Christ's Suffering</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Servants, submit to your masters with complete respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are cruel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For there is favor upon anyone who endures pain while suffering unjustly for the sake of conscience toward God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>What credit do you get if you endure when you sin and are beaten for it? But if you endure when you do good and suffer for it, this finds favor with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving an example so that you could follow in his footsteps.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>He committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten but entrusted himself to him who judges justly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to our sins and live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</content>

      <content>Wives and Husbands</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>In the same way, wives, submit to your own husbands, so that, even if some are disobedient to the word, they will be won without a word by the way you live</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>when they observe your pure and reverent conduct.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Do not adorn yourselves outwardly with elaborately braided hair, gold jewelry, or fancy clothes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Rather, let your adornment be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God's sight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For this is how the holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves in the past, by submitting to their own husbands,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You have become her children if you do good and do not give way to fear.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Husbands, in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker partner, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.</content>

      <content>Suffering for Righteousness' Sake</content>
    </fragment>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Finally, you must all be of one mind, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, and kind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but, on the contrary, bless, knowing that to this you were called, so that you may inherit a blessing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For, “Whoever wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>he must turn aside from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Now who will harm you if you become imitators of what is good?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But even if you do suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear people's threats or be troubled,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an explanation of the hope you have within you, with gentleness and respect,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>keeping a clear conscience, so that, when those who revile your good conduct in Christ speak against you as evildoers, they may be put to shame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is God's will, than to suffer for doing evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, so that he might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved through water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves us—not by removing dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.</content>

      <content>Therefore, since Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same mentality, because whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>so as to live his remaining time in the flesh no longer for the evil desires of men, but for the will of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For you have spent enough of your lives doing what the Gentiles like to do, walking in sensual indulgences, evil desires, excesses of wine, revelries, drinking bouts, and illicit idolatries.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>They are surprised when you do not run with them into the same flood of debauchery, so they revile you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>But they will give an account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to the dead, so that, though they have been judged in the flesh as men are, they might live in the spirit as God does.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>The end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be alert and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.</content>

      <content>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of power and of God rests upon you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.</content>

    <verse num="15">
      <content>None of you should suffer as a murderer, thief, evildoer, or meddler,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he should not be ashamed, but should glorify God in this matter.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God, and if it begins first with us, what will be the outcome for those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</content>

      <content>And, “If the righteous man is scarcely saved, what will become of the ungodly man and sinner?”</content>
