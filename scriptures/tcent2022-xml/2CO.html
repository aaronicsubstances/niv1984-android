<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we can comfort those experiencing any kind of affliction with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, which helps you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. And our hope for you is steadfast. If we are comforted, it is also for your comfort and salvation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But this happened so that we would not rely on ourselves, but on God, who raises the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He rescued us from such a terrible death, and continues to rescue us. We have put our hope in him that he will rescue us yet again</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>as you join in helping us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on your behalf for the favor granted to us through the prayers of many.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-h'><span>Paul's Change of Plans</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now this is the reason for our confidence: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with integrity and godly sincerity, not by worldly wisdom, but by the grace of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For we are not writing anything to you other than what you can read and understand. And I hope that you will understand completely—</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>just as you have understood us in part—that on the day of the Lord Jesus you will be proud of us just as we will be proud of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Because I was confident of this, I intended to come to you first, so that you would be blessed by a second visit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and return to you from Macedonia, and then have you send me on my way to Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Was I vacillating when I planned to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner, ready to say “Yes” and “No” at the same time?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you did not waver between “Yes” and “No.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom Silvanus, Timothy, and I preached among you, did not waver between “Yes” and “No.” On the contrary, in him God's answer has always been “Yes.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For in him every one of God's promises is “Yes,” and in him we say “Amen” to the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and who anointed us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>He has also sealed us and put his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But I call upon God as a witness against me, that the reason I did not return to Corinth was to spare you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Not that we rule over your faith; rather, we work with you for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So I made up my mind that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if I make you sorrowful, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have made sorrowful?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>That is why I wrote to you as I did, so that when I came I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence about you all that my joy would be yours.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you sorrow, but to let you know the abundant love I have for you.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-35-h'><span>Forgive the Sinner</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-36-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure (not to put it too severely) to all of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-37-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>This punishment by the majority is enough for that person.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-38-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So you should forgive and comfort him instead, so that he will not be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-39-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-40-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I wrote to you because I wanted to test your character and see if you would be obedient in everything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-41-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now if you forgive anyone of anything, I also forgive him. For if I have forgiven anyone of anything, I have done it for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-42-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>so that we might not be exploited by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his schemes.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-43-h'><span>Triumph in Christ</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-44-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-45-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus. So I took leave of the people there and went on to Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-46-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ everywhere.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we are a sweet fragrance of Christ ascending to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>to the latter we are a smell of death leading to death, but to the former we are a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is equal to such a task?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-49-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For we are not like others who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak with sincerity in the presence of God, as men sent from God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-61-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory even more.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-190-9-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter may not prove to be empty, but that you may be prepared, just as I said you would be.</span></div>
