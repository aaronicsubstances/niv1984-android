<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For this gospel I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>That is why I am suffering these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>May the Lord give mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.</span></div>
