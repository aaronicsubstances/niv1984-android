<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>With one accord they were all devoting themselves to prayer and supplication, along with Jesus' brothers and several women, including Mary the mother of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In those days Peter stood up among the disciples (a crowd of about one hundred twenty people who were gathered together). He said,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Peter continued, “For it is written in the Book of Psalms: ‘May his homestead become desolate; let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and, ‘May another take his position as overseer.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas (who was given the name Justus), and Matthias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then they prayed, “Lord, yoʋ know the hearts of all; show us which of these two men yoʋ have chosen</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, so he was added to the eleven apostles.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-1119-28-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Paul gathered a bundle of sticks, and when he was putting them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-1142-28-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Some were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-1143-28-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So they were in disagreement with one another and began to leave after Paul made this one final statement: “The Holy Spirit was right in saying to our fathers through Isaiah the prophet:</span></div>
