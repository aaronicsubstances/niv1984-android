<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle—appointed not by men nor through man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I am astonished that you are so quickly turning away from him who called you by the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are troubling you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-h'><span>How Paul Became an Apostle</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel I preached did not originate with man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, being far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But when God, who set me apart before I was born and called me by his grace, was pleased</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach good news about him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>They were only hearing people say, “The man who once persecuted us is now preaching the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So they were glorifying God because of me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I went up in response to a revelation and presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were held in high esteem, to make sure that I was not running or had not run in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he is a Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-35-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now this matter arose because of the false brothers who were secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-36-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But we did not yield to them in submission for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-37-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now from those who were esteemed to be something (what sort of men they once were makes no difference to me; God does not show partiality)—those, I say, who were held in high esteem added nothing to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-38-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-39-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For he who worked through Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised also worked through me in my apostleship to the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-40-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When James, Cephas, and John, who were esteemed as pillars of the church, recognized the grace given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and that they should go to the circumcised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-41-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-43-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was blameworthy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-44-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For he regularly ate with the Gentiles until certain men came from James. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself because he was afraid of the circumcision faction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-45-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-46-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly in accordance with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, “If yoʋ, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, why do yoʋ compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-h'><span>Justification by Faith</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>We who are Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-49-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by works of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-50-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if we ourselves have also been found to be sinners while seeking to be justified in Christ, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if I build up again the very things that I tore down, I show myself to be a transgressor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-52-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-53-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-54-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</span></div>

<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-57-h'><span>Law or Faith</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-58-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you to keep you from obeying the truth? In your presence, before your very eyes, Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-59-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-60-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now trying to be perfected by the flesh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-61-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Did you suffer so much in vain?—if indeed it was in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-62-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you perform the works of the law or because you hear with faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-63-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Remember, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-64-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore you must understand that those who have faith are the sons of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-65-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the nations will be blessed in yoʋ.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-66-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So then, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-67-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-68-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, because “the righteous will live by faith.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-69-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the law is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The person who does these things will live by them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-70-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-71-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-72-h'><span>The Law and the Promise</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-73-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Brothers, let me give an example from everyday life: When a man-made covenant is ratified, no one annuls it or adds to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-74-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “And to his descendants,” referring to many, but referring to one man it says, “And to yoʋr descendant,” who is Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-75-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>My point is this: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul a covenant previously ratified by God to Christ, so as to invalidate the promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-76-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by the promise; but God granted it to Abraham by a promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-77-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom the promise had been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-78-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now a mediator does not represent just one party, but God is one.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-79-h'><span>Slaves and Sons</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-80-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, truly righteousness would have come through the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-81-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise might be given on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-82-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined until the faith that was to come would be revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-83-3-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>The law, then, was our guardian until Christ came, so that we could be justified by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-84-3-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-85-3-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-86-3-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-87-3-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-88-3-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants and heirs according to the promise.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-91-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the master of all.</span></div>
