<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>God spoke to our fathers long ago at many times and in many ways through the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for our sins by giving his own life, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in high places,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-h'><span>The Son Is Superior to Angels</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For to which of the angels did God ever say, “Yoʋ are my Son; today I have begotten yoʋ”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Of the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire,”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but of the Son he says, “Yoʋr throne, O God, endures forever and ever; the scepter of yoʋr kingdom is a scepter of uprightness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Yoʋ have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, yoʋr God, has anointed yoʋ with the oil of gladness beyond yoʋr companions.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And, “In the beginning yoʋ, O Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of yoʋr hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>To which of the angels did God ever say, “Sit at my right hand until I make yoʋr enemies a footstool for yoʋr feet”?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if the message spoken through angels was valid and every transgression and disobedience received a just retribution,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>God also bore further witness with signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-h'><span>Jesus the Author of Salvation</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But in one place someone has testified: “What is man that yoʋ are mindful of him, or the son of man that yoʋ care for him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Yoʋ made him a little lower than the angels and crowned him with glory and honor;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>yoʋ put everything in subjection under his feet.” In subjecting everything to him, God left nothing that is not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For in bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have one Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>saying, “I will declare yoʋr name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing yoʋr praise.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again, “Here I am, with the children God has given me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, since the children all have flesh and blood, Jesus himself took on flesh and blood as well, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For surely it is not angels that he helps, but the descendants of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore he had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-39-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-43-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus Christ, the apostle and high priest of our confession,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-44-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>who was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-45-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Yet Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-46-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-47-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, which provided testimony to what would be spoken later.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-48-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Christ is faithful over God's house as a Son. And we are his house if indeed we hold our confidence firm to the end along with the hope in which we boast.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-50-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you hear his voice,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-51-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-52-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>where your fathers tried me, tested me, and saw my works for forty years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-53-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore I was angry with that generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts; they have not known my ways.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-54-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter my rest!’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-55-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Brothers, make sure that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-56-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But encourage one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-57-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For we have become sharers in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-58-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>As it is said, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-59-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For who were those who heard God's voice and yet rebelled? Was it not all whom Moses led out of Egypt?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-60-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-61-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And to whom did God swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-65-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains open, let us proceed with fear so that none of you may be found to have fallen short of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-66-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For we also have received good news just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united by faith with those who listened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-67-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, God has said, “As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter my rest!’ ” Now God's works have been finished from the foundation of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-68-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-69-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But again, God says in the passage above: “They will not enter my rest!”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-71-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>he again designates a certain day, calling it “Today,” as he says through David much later, in the passage already quoted, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-72-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-73-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-74-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For anyone who has entered God's rest has rested from his own works, just as God rested from his.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-75-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore let us make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-76-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-125-7-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now this Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-126-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and Abraham gave him a tenth of all the spoils. His name means “king of righteousness,” but he is also “king of Salem,” which means, “king of peace.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-127-7-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He is without father, without mother, and without genealogy; there is no beginning to his days or end to his life. But resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-128-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Consider how great this man must be, that even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-129-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now the law commands the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office to collect tithes from the people, that is, their brothers, even though their brothers are also descended from Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-130-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Melchizedek, who was not among the descendants of Levi, received a tithe from Abraham. He also blessed Abraham, who had received the promises.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-131-7-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>It is beyond all dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-132-7-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In the one case, tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, they are received by one who is attested to be living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-133-7-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-134-7-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For Levi was still in the loins of his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-135-h'><span>Jesus Compared to Melchizedek</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-136-7-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under this priesthood the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek rather than the order of Aaron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-137-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-138-7-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now he of whom these things are spoken belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-139-7-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For it is clear that our Lord arose from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priesthood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-140-7-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now this point becomes even more clear when there arises another priest like Melchizedek,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-141-7-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>one who has become a priest, not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent, but through the power of an endless life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-142-7-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For God testifies, “Yoʋ are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-143-7-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and ineffectiveness</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-144-7-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-145-7-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And none of this happened without an oath. Aaron's descendants become priests without an oath,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-146-7-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>but Jesus was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him, “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘Yoʋ are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-147-7-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Accordingly, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-148-7-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-149-7-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>but because Jesus continues forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-150-7-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Therefore he is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-151-7-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>It was fitting for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-152-7-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He has no need, like the other high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all when he offered up himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-153-7-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-157-8-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the Majesty's throne in heaven,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-158-8-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>where he serves as a minister of the holy places and the true tabernacle, which was set up by the Lord, not by man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-159-8-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-160-8-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-161-8-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to build the tabernacle, he was warned by God, “Be sure to make everything according to the pattern that was shown to yoʋ on the mountain.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-162-8-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But as it is, the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to the old priesthood as the covenant he mediates is superior to the old covenant, since it has been enacted on better promises.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-163-8-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-164-8-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But finding fault with it, God says to the people, “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-166-8-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-167-8-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>No longer will a man teach his fellow citizen or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-169-8-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>In speaking of “a new covenant,” he has made the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-174-9-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first room were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-175-9-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Behind the second veil was a room called the Holy of Holies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-176-9-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>It had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant, which was overlaid on all sides with gold.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-177-9-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-178-9-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room of the tabernacle, performing their sacred duties.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-180-9-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>By this arrangement the Holy Spirit was showing that the way into the holy places had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-184-9-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when Christ came as high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands (that is, not of this creation),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-185-9-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>he entered once for all into the holy places, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-186-9-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-187-9-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your consciences from dead works to serve the living God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-188-9-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>That is why he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-189-9-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For in the case of a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-191-9-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>That is why even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-192-9-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For when Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll itself and all the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-193-9-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-194-9-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>In the same way, he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-195-9-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Indeed, according to the law nearly everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-196-9-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So it was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but for the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-197-9-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For Christ did not enter holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true ones; he entered heaven itself, so that he might now appear before God on our behalf.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-198-9-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself many times, as the high priest enters the holy places year after year with blood that is not his own,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-199-9-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world.

<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-200-9-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And just as it is appointed for men to die once and then face judgment,</span></div>
