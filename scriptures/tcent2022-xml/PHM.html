<h2 id='tcent2022-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-2-h'><span>Greeting</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved friend and fellow worker,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and also to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in yoʋr house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-6-h'><span>Philemon's Love and Faith</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-7-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I give thanks to my God, always making mention of yoʋ in my prayers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-8-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>because I hear of yoʋr love for all the saints and the faith that yoʋ have toward the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I pray that yoʋr fellowship with us in the faith may be effective in deepening yoʋr understanding of every blessing that we have in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We are very thankful for the comfort we have received from yoʋr love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through yoʋ, brother.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-11-h'><span>Paul's Appeal for Onesimus</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-12-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, although I am bold enough in Christ to command yoʋ to do what is right,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-13-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I would rather appeal to yoʋ on the basis of love. I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner for Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-14-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>appeal to yoʋ on behalf of my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-15-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Once he was useless to yoʋ, but now he is useful both to yoʋ and to me. I am sending him back,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and I ask yoʋ to receive him, that is, my very own heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in yoʋr place during my imprisonment for the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But I did not want to do anything without yoʋr consent, so that yoʋr good deed would not be done out of compulsion, but of yoʋr own free will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from yoʋ for an hour was so that yoʋ might have him back forever,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, but even more so to yoʋ, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So if yoʋ consider me to be a partner, receive him as yoʋ would receive me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>If he has wronged yoʋ in any way or owes yoʋ anything, charge it to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention that yoʋ owe me yoʋr very own life).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from yoʋ in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Trusting in yoʋr obedience, I write to yoʋ, knowing that yoʋ will do even more than I ask.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>At the same time, I want yoʋ to prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you soon.</span></div>
<div class='fragment heading' id='tcent2022-bookmark-27-h'><span>Final Greetings</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-28-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus greets yoʋ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-29-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='tcent2022-bookmark-30-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>
