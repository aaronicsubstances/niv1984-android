    <verse num="1">
      <content>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the earth was invisible and unfurnished and there was darkness over this abyss; and a breath of God was brought on above the water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And God said, Let there be Light; and there was light.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And God saw the light that it was good. And God made a separation between the light and the darkness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And God called the light day; and the darkness he called night. And there was an evening and there was a morning. The first day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water; and let it make a separation between water and water. And it was so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>God made the firmament; and God made a separation between the water which was below the firmament and the water which was above the firmament.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And God called the firmament, heaven. And God saw that it was good. And there was an evening and there was a morning. The second day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Then God said, Let the water which is below the heaven be gathered into one receptacle and let the dry land appear. And it was so. The waters which were below the heaven were gathered into their several collections, and the dry land appeared.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And God called the dry land, earth; and the collections of the waters he called, seas. And God saw that it was good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And God said, Let the earth produce the grassy plant with sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and the fruit bearing tree together with the fruit, the seed of which is in it according to kind, upon the earth. And it was so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>The earth indeed produced the grassy plant with sowing seed according to kind and according to likeness, and the fruit tree together with fruit, the seed of which is in it, according to kind, in the earth. And God saw that it was good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And there was an evening and there was a morning. The third day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Then God said, Let there be luminaries in the firmament of heaven, to give light on the earth; to make a separation between the day and the night: and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>and let them be for an illumination in the firmament of heaven so as to shine on the earth. And it was so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>God indeed made the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for the regulations of the day, and the lesser luminary, with the stars, for the regulations of the night.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And God placed them in the firmament of heaven so as to shine on the earth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>and to regulate the day and the night, and to make a division between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And there was an evening and there was a morning. The fourth day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Then God said, Let the waters produce moving creatures having life; and winged creatures flying above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And it was so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>God indeed made the great sea monsters and every species of moving animals which the waters produced according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to kind. And God saw that they were good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And God blessed them saying, Increase and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let flying creatures be multiplied on the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And there was an evening and there was a morning. The fifth day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Then God said, Let the earth produce animal life according to kind; four footed beasts and reptiles and wild beasts of the earth according to kind. And it was so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>God indeed made the wild beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and all the reptiles of the earth according to kind. And God saw that they were good.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Then God said, Let us make man after our image and after a likeness; and let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the cattle, and the whole earth, and all the reptiles which creep on the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>So God made man. After an image of God he made him. A male and a female he made them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And God blessed them saying, Increase and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all the cattle, and all the earth, and all the reptiles which creep on the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Moreover God said, Behold I have given you every seed bearing plant, the sowing seed which is on the whole earth, and every tree which hath in itself the fruit of seminal seed, you shall have for food:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And to all the beasts of the earth, and to all the birds of the air, and to every reptile on the earth, which hath in it animal life, I have also given every green herb for food. And it was so.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And God saw all the things which he had made, and behold they were very good. And there was an evening and there was a morning. The sixth day.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Thus were finished the heaven and the earth and all the arrangement of them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And God finished on the sixth day these his works which he made; and on the seventh day he desisted from all these works of his which he made.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it; because on it he rested from all these works of his which God had taken occasion to make.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>This is the genealogy of heaven and earth. When they were made, on the day when the Lord God had made the heaven and the earth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>and all the verdure of the field, before it was on the earth, and every herb of the field, before it sprang up, (for God had not rained on the earth, nor was there a man to till it;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>but a fountain ascended out of the earth and watered the whole face of the ground,)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>then God formed the man, dust from the earth, and breathed upon his face a breath of life, and the man became a living soul.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And God planted a garden in Eden towards the east and placed there the man whom he had made.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And God caused to spring up there also out of that ground every tree beautiful to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree for the purpose of knowing what was to be known of good and evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now a river issueth out of Eden to water the garden: thence it is divided into four heads.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>The name of the first is Physon. This is that which encircleth the whole country Evilat, where there is gold,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>and the gold of that country is good. There also is the carbuncle and the Prasian stone.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the name of the second river is Geon. This is that which encircleth the whole country of Ethiopia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And the third river is Tigris. This is that which floweth down over against the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And the Lord God took the man whom he had made, and placed him in this garden of pleasure to work it and to watch.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, Of every tree which is in the garden for food, thou mightest have eaten;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>but from this tree, that you may know good and evil, you must not eat of it. On the day you eat of it, by death you shall die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: let us make for him a helper correspondent to himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Now God had also formed out of the earth all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called every living creature; that was its name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>So Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to all the fowls of the air, and to all the wild beasts of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Then God brought an ecstasy upon Adam and caused him to sleep, and took one of his ribs and filled up flesh instead thereof.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And God built up the rib, which he took from Adam, into a woman, and brought her to Adam.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And Adam said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, let her be called woman. Because she was taken out of her man,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>therefore a man is to leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Now the two, both Adam and his wife were naked, and were not ashamed.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>But the serpent was the wisest of all the beasts on the earth which the Lord God had made, and the serpent said to the woman, Why hath God said, you must not eat of every tree of the garden?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, You shall not eat of it, nor touch it, that you may not die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And the serpent said to the woman, You will not by death die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For God knew that in the day you eat thereof, your eyes would be opened and you would be like gods knowing good and evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the woman saw that the tree was good for food; and that it is delightful to see with the eyes; and that to exercise understanding is comely, so having taken some of the fruit thereof, she ate and gave also to her husband with her. And when they had eaten,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>the eyes of them both were opened, and they perceived that they were naked. And they sewed together fig leaves and made for themselves girdles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And when they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening, both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, among the trees of the garden.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, Adam, where art thou?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And he said to him, I heard the sound of thee walking in the garden and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And God said to him, Who told thee that thou art naked, if so be thou hast not eaten of the tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat of this?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And Adam said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the Lord God said to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent seduced me and I ate.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed from all the cattle and from all the beasts which are upon the earth. Upon thy breast and belly thou shalt go and shalt eat earth all the days of thy life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman; and between thy seed and her seed. He will wound thy head, and thou wilt wound his heel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrows and thy anguish. With sorrows thou shalt bear children and to thy husband shall be thy recourse, and he shall rule over thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat, the ground is cursed by thy labours. With sorrows thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Thorns and thistles it shall cause to spring up for thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>By the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread until thou return into the earth out of which thou wast taken; for earth thou art and to earth thou shalt return.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was to be the mother of all the living.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin and cloathed them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And God said, Behold Adam was made like one of us to know good and evil. And now perhaps he may stretch forth his hand and take of the tree of life and eat, so shall he live forever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of pleasure to till the ground out of which he was taken.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And when he put Adam out he caused him to dwell over against the garden of pleasure and stationed the Cherubim and the whirling flame of fire to keep the way to the tree of life.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain tilled the ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And when in process of time Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>and Abel also brought, he indeed of the firstlings of his flock even some of the fattest of them, God looked upon Abel and on his gifts;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>but upon Cain and upon his sacrifices he did not look with regard. Thereupon Cain was exceedingly grieved and his countenance became dejected.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the Lord God said to Cain, Why art thou become sorrowful and why is thy countenance dejected?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Though thou hast offered right, yet if thou hast not rightly divided, hast thou not sinned? Be composed. To thee shall be his recourse, and thou shalt rule over him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the plain. And when they were in the plain, Cain rose upon Abel his brother and slew him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And when the Lord God said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? he said I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Then the Lord said, What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me out of the ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now therefore thou art cursed from this land, which hath opened its mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>When thou tillest the ground, it will not henceforth yield thee its strength. Thou shalt be in a state of anguish and terror in this land.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And Cain said to the Lord God, Is my fault too great to be forgiven?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>If thou castest me out this day from the face of this land and I be hid from thy presence and be in a state of anguish and terror in the land, it will come to pass that whoever findeth me will kill me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And the Lord said to him, Not so. Whosoever killeth Cain shall suffer seven fold vengeance. And the Lord God gave a sign to Cain, that whoever found him would not kill him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So Cain went out from the presence of God and dwelt in the land of Naid over against Eden.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and brought forth Enoch. And he employed himself in building a city and he called the city Enoch after his son's name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And to Enoch was born Gaidad; and Gaidad begot Maleleel, and Maleleel begot Mathousala, and Mathousala begot Lamech.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Lamech took to himself two wives. The name of the first was Aria; and the name of the second Sella.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And Ada bore Jobel. He was the father of them who dwell in tents, feeding cattle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And the name of his brother was Jonbal. He was the inventor of the psaltery and kithara.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>As for Sella, she also bore Thobel, and he was a smith, a manufacturer of brass and iron; and the sister of Thobel was Noema.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella, Hearken to my voice, ye wives of Lamech, Listen attentively to my words: For have I slain a man that I should be wounded, And a young man that I should be hurt?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>For seven fold vengeance was to be taken for Cain; But for Lamech will be taken seventy times seven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and brought forth a son and called his name Seth, saying, For God hath raised up for me another seed in the place of Abel whom Cain slew.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And Seth had a son; and he called his name Enos. He hoped that he would invoke the name of the Lord God.</content>

      <content>Haste therefore to escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou get there. For this cause he called the name of that city, Segor.</content>

      <content>The sun was risen on the earth when Lot entered Segor;</content>

      <content>Lot went up out of Segor, and he and his two daughters with him settled in the mountains; for he was afraid to dwell in Segor. So he and his two daughters with him took up their abode in a cave.</content>

      <content>And Esau said, His name is rightly called Jacob; for lo! he hath now supplanted me a second time. He took from me my rights of primogeniture; and now he hath taken my blessing. Then Esau said to his father, Hast thou not, father, reserved a blessing for me?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>And Isaak in reply said to Esau, Seeing I have made him thy lord and made all his brethren his servants and have also supported him with corn and wine, what can I do for thee, my son?</content>

    <verse num="38">
      <content>And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, father? Bless, I beseech thee, me also, father. And Isaak being deeply affected, Esau raised his voice and wept.</content>

      <content>And Isaak his father answered and said to him, Behold thy dwelling shall border on the fatness of the earth and on the dew of heaven from above.</content>

      <content>Then Jacob proceeded on, and went to the land of the east to Laban the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, the brother of Rebekka who was Jacob and Esau's mother.</content>

      <content>And looking, he saw a well in the plain and there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. Now there was a great stone on the mouth of the well,</content>

    <verse num="3">
      <content>and when all the flocks were collected there, the shepherds rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep; and then put the stone again in its place on the mouth of the well.</content>

      <content>And when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</content>

      <content>And when Laban heard the name of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and having embraced him he kissed him, and brought him to his house. And Jacob related to him all these circumstances.</content>

      <content>Receive these my blessings which I have brought thee; because God hath dealt bountifully with me, and is all things to me. So he pressed him and he took them.</content>

      <content>and this is the history of Jacob's posterity. When Joseph was seventeen years of age and feeding his father's sheep with his brothers, as he was young, namely with the sons of Balla and the sons of Zelpha his father's wives, they carried an ill report against Joseph to Israel their father.</content>

      <content>Besides Joseph having dreamed a dream told it to his brothers</content>

      <content>And he had another dream and told this to his father and his brothers and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream, as if the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.</content>

      <content>Upon which his father rebuked him saying, What is this dream which thou hast dreamed? What! Shall I and thy mother and thy brothers come and bow down to thee on the ground?</content>

      <content>So his brothers envied him; but his father pondered the matter.</content>

      <content>After this his brothers having gone to Sychem to feed their father's flocks,</content>

      <content>Now when they saw him at a great distance before he came near them, they wickedly thought of killing him</content>

      <content>Then they sat down to eat bread. And raising their eyes they looked; and lo! Ismaelite travellers were coming out of Galaad and their camels were loaded with spiceries, with balm and stacte, which they were carrying to Egypt.</content>

      <content>Thereupon Judas said to his brothers, What advantage will it be though we slay our brother and conceal his blood?</content>

      <content>And when the Madienite merchants came, they drew him up. They lifted Joseph up out of the pit and sold him to the Ismaelites for twenty pieces of gold; and they carried Joseph down to Egypt.</content>

      <content>Now when Reuben came back to the pit and did not see Joseph in it, he rent his cloaths</content>

    <verse num="31">
      <content>Then they took Joseph's coat, and having killed a kid of the goats they besmeared the coat with the blood</content>

      <content>And it appeared evil in the sight of God that he had done this, therefore he caused him also to die.</content>

      <content>But it happened that at the end of two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he was standing by the river;</content>

      <content>And in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent for all the interpreters of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharao.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Upon this the chief butler spoke to Pharao, saying, I this day acknowledge my fault.</content>

      <content>This is the thing which I have said to Pharao, God hath shewn Pharao what he is about to do.</content>

      <content>so that the plenty will not be known in the land, by reason of the famine which will come after it: for it will be very great.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And in as much as the dream of Pharao was doubled, the thing which God had determined will surely come to pass; and God is hasting to do it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Now therefore look out for a man of prudence and understanding, and set him over the land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>And let Pharao appoint and set governors of districts over the whole land, and let them send in a fifth of all the products of the land of Egypt, during the seven years of plenty,</content>

      <content>and collect all the eatables of those seven good years which are coming. And let food be collected under the care of Pharao, and eatables stored in the cities.</content>

      <content>Moreover Pharao said to Joseph, Behold I have set thee this day over all the land of Egypt,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>And Pharao took off the ring from his own hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him with a cotton robe, and put a chain of gold about his neck;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>and caused him to mount a chariot next to that of his own. And a herald made proclamation before him. And when he had set him over all the land of Egypt,</content>

      <content>Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao. Without thee no man shall lift up his hand in all the land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>And Pharao called Joseph's name Psonthomphanech and gave him Aseneth a daughter of Petephres the priest of Heliopolis to be his wife.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>Now Joseph was thirty years old, when he stood before Pharao king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharao and went through all the land of Egypt.</content>

      <content>And in the seven years of plenty the land produced in vast abundance</content>

      <content>and he collected all the varieties of food of those seven years, in which there was plenty in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he stored the eatable productions of the fields around.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>So Joseph collected food like the sand of the sea in great abundance until it could not be numbered, for it was innumerable.</content>

    <verse num="53">
      <content>And when the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt were past,</content>

    <verse num="54">
      <content>the seven years of famine began to come as Joseph said. And there was a famine in the whole earth, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</content>

    <verse num="55">
      <content>And when all the land of Egypt began to be in want and the people cried to Pharao for bread, Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph and do whatever he saith to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="56">
      <content>As the famine was over the face of the whole earth, when Joseph opened all his granaries and sold to all the Egyptians,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="57">
      <content>all the countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine was great in the whole earth.</content>

      <content>Now Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then they said, Thy servants were twelve brothers in the land of Chanaan. And lo! the youngest is now with our father; but the other is no more.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Upon this Joseph said, It is as I said, you are spies.</content>

      <content>By this you shall be proved. By the health of Pharao you shall not depart hence unless your youngest brother come hither.</content>

      <content>So he committed them to prison three days.</content>

      <content>they said one to another, We indeed are to blame in respect to our brother. Because we disregarded the anguish of his soul, when he intreated us and we would not hear him; for this cause therefore this affliction is come upon us.</content>
