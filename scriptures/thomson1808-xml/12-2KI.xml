    <verse num="1">
      <content>After the death of Achab, Moab broke covenant with Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>and Ochozias fell through the lattice in his upper chamber at Samaria, and was sick, whereupon he sent messengers, saying to them, Go and inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron, whether I shall recover from this sickness of mine.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And when they set out to inquire of him, the angel of the Lord called Elias the Thesbite, and said, Arise and go, meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that you are going to inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now is not this the case, saith the Lord, From the bed to which thou art gone up thou shalt not come down, for thou shalt assuredly die?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So Elias went and spoke to them, and the messengers returned to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Thereupon he said to them, Why are you returned? To which they replied, There came up a man to meet us, and he said to us, Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou goest to inquire of Baal, the fly-god of Akkaron? Now is not this the case; From the bed to which thou hast gone up thou shalt not come down, for thou shalt assuredly die?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now when they who returned told the king what Elias had said, he said to them, What sort of a man was he who came up to meet you, and spoke these words to you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And they said to him, He was a hairy man, girt about the loins with a leathern girdle. Upon which he said, This is Elias the Thesbite.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Then he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty, who went up to him. Now behold Elias was sitting on the top of the mount. And when the captain spoke to him and said, Man of God, the king hath sent for thee, come down.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Elias, in reply, said to the captain, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. So there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But the king persisted, and sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And the captain spoke to him and said, Man of God, thus saith the king, Come down quickly.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Whereupon Elias in reply, said to him, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. Accordingly there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Still the king persisted, and sent another captain and his fifty. But when the third captain came he fell upon his knees before Elias, and with entreaties addressed him, saying, man of God, let my life and the lives of thy servants, these fifty, be precious in thy sight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Behold, fire hath come down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty; but now let my life, I beseech thee, be precious in thy sight.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, and said, Go down with him; be not afraid of them. So Elias arose and went down with him to the king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And Elias spoke to him and said, Thus saith the Lord, Why didst thou send messengers to inquire of Baal the fly-god of Akkaron? Is not this the case? From the bed to which thou hast gone up thou shalt not come down: for thou shalt assuredly die?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So he died according to the word of the Lord, which Elias spake.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Now the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, behold are they not written in the book of the journal of the kings of Israel? And Joram son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria, twelve years, commencing in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not in the manner his brothers, nor as his mother had done. He indeed removed the pillars of Baal which his father had erected, and broke them to pieces. Nevertheless he adhered to the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin, and did not depart from them. Therefore the Lord was provoked to wrath against the house of Achab.</content>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now when the Lord was about to take up Elias as it were with a whirlwind into heaven, Elias went with Elisha from Galgala.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Now Elias had said to Elisha, Tarry here I pray thee, for God hath sent me to Baithel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went to Baithel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And the sons of the prophets who were at Baithel, came to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that the Lord will take thy master to-day from over thy head? And he said, I know it. Hold your peace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then Elias said to Elisha, Tarry here I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, I will not forsake thee. So they went to Jericho.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, came to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that to-day the Lord will take away thy master from over thy head? And he said, I indeed know it; hold your peace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Then Elias said to him, Tarry here I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to the Jordan. But Elisha replied, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they both proceeded on.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And fifty men, sons of the prophets stood over against them at a distance when they two stopped at the Jordan.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And Elias took his mantle and having rolled it up, he smote the water, and the water parted this way and that, so that they both crossed on dry ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And when they had crossed, Elias said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken up from thee. Whereupon Elisha said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit on me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Elias said, Thou hast put me to a stand by this request. If thou seest me taken up from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not; it cannot be granted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And as they proceeded on conversing as they went, behold a chariot of fire, with horses of fire, made a separation between them; and Elias was carried up with a whirlwind as it were into heaven.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And Elisha saw and cried with a loud voice, My father! my father! The chariot of Israel and the driver thereof! And when he saw him no more, he took hold of his garment and rent it in two pieces.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then he took up the mantle of Elias which fell from on high, and on his return back, he stood on the bank of the Jordan,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>and took the mantle of Elias which had fallen from him, and smote the water and said, Where is the God of Elias now! And when he had smitten the waters they parted this way and that, so Elisha crossed over.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elias hath rested on Elisha, so they went to meet him, and made obeisance to him by bowing to the ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Then they said to him, Behold there are with thy servants fifty valiant men. Let them, we pray thee, go and seek thy master. Perhaps a blast of the Lord hath lifted him up and cast him by the Jordan, either on one of the mountains, or one of the hills. And Elisha said, You shall not send.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But when they pressed him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. So they sent fifty men. And when they had searched three days, but did not find him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>they returned to Elisha, who abode at Jericho. And Elisha said to them, Did I not tell you, you should not go?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Then the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold the situation of the city is good as our lord seeth, but the water is bad and the ground barren.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Thereupon Elisha said to them, Bring me a new pitcher and put salt therein. And when they had got one and brought it to him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Elisha went to the spring of the waters, and threw the salt in there and said, Thus saith the Lord, I cure the waters. There shall no more be thence death or barren ground.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>So the waters were healed, and continue so to this day, according to the word which Elisha spoke.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Then he went up thence to Baithel, and as he was going up he met in the way, little boys who had come out of the city, and who mocked him saying, Ascend bald head! Ascend!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And looking back upon them, he beheld them, and denounced a curse against them, in the name of the Lord. And behold there came two bears from the forest, and they tore forty two of the boys.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Thence he went to mount Karmel, and thence returned to Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now Joram son of Achab, began his reign in Israel in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and reigned twelve years,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>and did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father nor his mother. He indeed removed the pillars of Baal which his father had erected;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>but he adhered to the sin of Jeroboam son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, and did not depart from that.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now Mosa king of Moab, was a Noked one who paid tribute in sheep and rebelliously withheld from the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with the wool.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And it happened that after the death of Achab, when the king of Moab broke covenant with Israel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>king Joram was at that time gone from Samaria and was reviewing Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So he proceeded on and sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying, The king of Moab hath broken covenant with me, wilt thou go with me to battle against Moab? To which he replied, I will go up. He is the same to me as he is to thee. My people is as thy people; my horses as thy horses.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then he said, Which way must I go up? To which he answered, By the way to the wilderness of Edom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So the king of Israel and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went out and took a circuit of seven days, and there was no water for the army nor for the cattle which attended them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And when the king of Israel said, Alas! for the Lord hath called the three kings who have come thus far, to deliver them into the hand of Moab;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him? Whereupon one of the king of Israel's servants in reply, said, Elisha son of Saphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elias.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And Josaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel, with Josaphat king of Juda and the king of Edom, went down to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What hast thou to do with me? Go to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, I am fearful that the Lord hath called these three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>To which Elisha replied, As the Lord of hosts liveth in whose presence I stand, were it not that I respect the person of Josaphat king of Juda, I would not look on thee nor see thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>But now bring me a musician. And when the musician played, the hand of the Lord came upon him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>and he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For thus saith the Lord, You shall not see wind nor shall you see rain, nevertheless this valley shall be filled with water that you and your beasts and your cattle may drink.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And this is but a small matter in the eyes of the Lord; for I will deliver Moab into your hands,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>and you shall smite every fenced city, and cut down every goodly tree. And all the wells of water you shall stop up, and every good piece of ground you shall mar with stones.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Accordingly in the morning when the sacrifice ascended, behold there came water by the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now all Moab upon hearing that the three kings were coming to fight against them, had sounded the alarm, To arms from every place all who wear a girdle, and having repeated the alarm Woe, were drawn up at their border.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And when they arose in the morning and the sun shone on the waters, the Moabites saw the waters over against them red like blood,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and said, This is the blood of the sword. The kings have fought and every man hath slain his fellow, now therefore to the spoils, Moab!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites arose and smote Moab. And as the Moabites fled before them they entered the country advancing and smiting Moab.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>The cities they demolished, and on every good piece of ground they threw, every man his stone. And when they had filled it and stopped up every fountain, and cut down every goodly tree, until they left only the stones of the wall of Katheremenus, then the slingers surrounded this and smote it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword, to cut their way through to the king of Edom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>But when he could not, he took his son, his first born, whom he had made king in his stead, and offered him up as a whole burnt offering on the walls. Upon which great commiseration came upon Israel, and they departed from him, and returned into their own land.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>When a woman, a widow, of one of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha, saying, Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one who feared the Lord, and the creditor is come to take my two sons to be his slaves,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Elisha said to her, What can I do for thee? Tell me; What hast thou in thy house? To which she replied, Thy servant hath nothing in the house, but only the oil with which I anoint myself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Thereupon he said to her, Go and borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels. Spare not in borrowing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Then go in and shut the door on thee and thy sons, and pour out into these vessels, setting aside that which is full.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So she went away from him; and having shut the door on herself and her sons, they brought to her and she poured out until the vessels were filled.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And when she said to her sons, Bring me another vessel, and they replied, There is not a vessel more, the oil stopped.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Then she went and told the man of God, and Elisha said to her, Go and sell the oil and pay thy debts, and live thou and thy children on the oil which is left.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>It happened also that one day when Elisha went to Soman, a woman of rank there prevailed on him to eat bread. So as oft as he went thither he called in to eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Whereupon the woman said to her husband, Behold I perceive that the man of God; this holy man passeth by us on all occasions,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>let us I pray thee, prepare for him a small room up stairs, and let us put there for him a bed and a table and a chair and a lamp, so that when he cometh to us he may turn in thither.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>So one day when he went there he turned aside into the chamber, and having slept there,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>he said to his servant Giezi, Call me this Somanite. So he called her and she stood before him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>(Now he had said to his servant, Say, I pray thee, to her, Behold as thou hast taken all this trouble for us, what must I do for thee? Hast thou any message to send to the king or to the general of the army? And she had said to him, I indeed dwell in the midst of my people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Upon which he said to Giezi, What can be done for her? And his servant Giezi replied, She indeed hath not a son and her husband is old.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So when he had called her and she stood at the door,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Elisha said to her, This time twelve month, about this very hour thou alive and well hast embraced a son. To which she replied, Nay, my lord, do not deceive thy handmaid.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So the woman conceived and bore a son about that time twelve month, about the very hour, being alive and well as Elisha said to her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But when the child grew up, happening to go out to his father to the reapers,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>he said to his father, My head! my head! Whereupon he said to the servant, Carry him to his mother.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>So he carried him to his mother, and he lay on her lap till noon and died.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And when she had carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, she shut the door on him and came out</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>and called her husband and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants and one of the asses that I may go speedily to the man of God and return.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And he said to her, Why wouldst thou go to him to-day? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. To which she replied, Peace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>So when he had saddled the ass, she said to her servant, Come, drive on. Slack not thy gait for me, unless I order thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Come, press forward and go to the man of God to mount Karmel. So she proceeded on and came to the man of God to the mount. Now Elisha saw her coming and said to his servant Giezi, Behold yonder is the Somanite,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>run and meet her and say, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child? And she said, It is well.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>But when she came to Elisha on the mount, she took hold of his feet, whereupon Giezi went near to push her back. But Elisha said, Let her alone: for her soul is full of sorrow and the Lord hath hid the cause from me and hath not told me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Then she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Thereupon Elisha said to Giezi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go. If thou meetest a man salute him not. And if any man salute thee, return him no answer. And lay my staff on the face of the child.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>But the mother of the child said, As the Lord liveth and thy soul liveth I will not leave thee. So Elisha arose and followed her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Now Giezi had gone before her and laid the staff on the child's face; but there was no voice, nor attention. So when he came back and met him he said to him, The child is not awaked.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>And when Elisha came to the house, behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Then Elisha went into the house and shut the door upon them two; and having prayed to the Lord</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>he went up and lay down upon the child and put his mouth on the child's mouth, and his eyes on its eyes, and his hands on its hands, and bent himself down upon it; and the flesh of the child was wanned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>Then he withdrew, and when he had walked backward and forward in the house, he went up and bent himself upon the child seven times, and the child opened its eyes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>Whereupon Elisha called Giezi and said, Call the Somanite. So he called her. And when she came to him, Elisha said, Take up thy son.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>Thereupon she came and fell at his feet, and having made obeisance to him by bowing to the ground she took up her son and went out.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>When Elisha returned to Galgala there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets sat before him. And Elisha said to his servant, Put on the large kettle and boil some pottage for the sons of the prophets.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And one went out into the fields to gather herbs, and having found a vine in the fields he gathered from it a lapful of wild berries and threw them into the kettle of soup; for they did not know them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>Then they poured out for the men to eat: but when they had eaten of the pottage, behold they cried out and said, There is death in the kettle, man of God: for they could not eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Whereupon he said, Take some meal and throw it into the kettle. Then Elisha said to his servant Giezi, Pour out for the people and let them eat. And there was no more any thing disagreeable in the kettle.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>After that there came a man from Baithariso and brought to the man of God, of the first fruits twenty loaves of barley bread and some fig cakes. And he said, Give these to the people and let them eat.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>And when his servant said, Why should I set this before a hundred men? He said, Give it to the people and let them eat; for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat and leave.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>So they ate and left according to the word of the Lord.</content>

    <verse num="1">
      <content>Naiman the captain general of the army of Syria, was a man great in the sight of his master and highly honoured; because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria. But this man who was mighty in power, was leprous.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Now the light armed bands had gone from Syria and brought away captive out of the land of Israel, a little girl and she waited on Naiman's wife.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And she said to her mistress, that my master were before the prophet of God who is in Samaria: Then would he cure him of his leprosy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>And she went in and told her lord and said, Thus and thus hath the little girl spoken, who is from the land of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Upon this the king of Syria said to Naiman, Come, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. So he set out and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten suits of apparel</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>and carried the letter to the king of Israel, the purport of which was, Now when this letter shall come to thee, behold I have sent to thee my servant Naiman that thou mayst cure him of his leprosy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And when the king of Israel had read the letter he rent his clothes and said, Am I God to kill or give life, that he sendeth to me to cure a man of his leprosy? For only consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a pretence for quarreling with me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But when Elisha heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes he sent to him saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? Let Naiman come to me and know that there is a prophet in Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So Naiman went with his horses and chariot and stopped at the doors of Elisha's house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Elisha sent a messenger to him saying, Go and wash thyself seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall return to thee and thou shalt be cleansed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Thereupon Naiman was inflamed with indignation and went away saying, Behold I thought he would at least come out and stand and call on the name of his God, or lay his hand on the place, and cure the leprous part.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Are not Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Why may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? So he turned and went away in a rage.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But his servants drew near and said to him, Had the prophet enjoined thee some great thing, wouldst thou not do it? And wilt thou not, because he said, Wash and be clean?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Then Naiman went down, and when he had dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the prophet, his flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Upon this he and all his retinue, returned to Elisha, and came and stood before him and said, Behold I now know that there is not a God in all the earth but only in Israel. Now therefore accept this acknowledgment, from thy servant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But Elisha said, As the Lord liveth in whose presence I stand, I will not receive it. And when he urged him to take it and he refused,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Naiman said, But if not; pray let there be given to thy servant a couple of mules burden of earth; for thy servant will no more offer a whole burnt offering or a sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>But in this thing may the Lord be gracious to thy servant. When my master goeth into the house of Remman to worship there, should he lean on my hand, and I bow down in the house of Remman, when he boweth down there, may the Lord, I pray, be gracious to thy servant in this respect.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And Elisha said to Naiman, Go in peace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now when he had gone a little way from him, Giezi the servant of Elisha said, Behold my master hath spared Naiman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hand what he brought. As the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and receive something from him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>So Giezi went after Naiman with all speed. And when Naiman saw him running after him, he turned about from his chariot to meet him. And he said, Peace!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>My master hath sent me saying, Behold there are just come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Give, I pray thee for them a talent of silver and two suits of apparel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>To which he replied, Take two talents of silver. So he took two talents of silver, in two bags, and two suits of raiment and laid them on two of his servants and they carried them before him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And when he came to a dark place, he took them from the hands of his servants, and laid them up in the house. And when he had dismissed the men,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Whence comest thou, Giezi? To which he replied, Thy servant hath not gone any where.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And Elisha said to him, My heart indeed did not go with thee, when the man turned about from his chariot to meet thee. Now thou hast received silver; and thou hast now received the apparel and olive yards and vine yards, and flocks and herds and men servants, and maid servants;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>but the leprosy of Naiman shall cleave to thee, and thy seed forever. So he went out from his presence, leprous like snow.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>When the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold the place where we dwell before thee is too confined for us;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>let us we pray thee, go to the Jordan, and take thence every man a piece of timber, and build there for ourselves a dwelling, and he said, Go;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>one of them intreated him saying, Come along with thy servants; and he said I will go.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan and were cutting the timber,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>behold as one was felling the beam the ax dropped in the water. Upon which he cried out, my lord! Now it was quite hid.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And when he had shewed him the place, he cut a chip of wood and threw it there, and the ax swam on the surface.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And he said, Take it up. So he stretched forth his hand and took it up.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>When the king of Syria was carrying on a war against Israel, and consulted with his servants saying, In such and such a place I will encamp in ambush,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Elisha sent to the king of Israel saying, Take care not to pass by such a place, for the Syrians lie concealed there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And when the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisha mentioned, and avoided it more than once or twice,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>the heart of the king of Syria was moved at this. And he called his servants and said to them, Why will you not tell me, who it is that betrayeth me to the king of Israel?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Thereupon one of his servants said, That is not the case, my lord, king! For it is Elisha the prophet in Israel who telleth the king of Israel all the words which thou speakest in thy bed chamber.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then he said, Go see where he is, and I will send and take him. And when they told him saying, Behold he is at Dothaim,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>he sent thither horses and chariots, even a strong detachment. And they came by night and surrounded the city.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And when Elisha's servant arose early in the morning and went out, behold an army with horses and chariots surrounded the city, whereupon the servant said to him, my lord, what shall we do?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And Elisha said, Fear not; for there are more with us than with them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Then Elisha prayed and said, Lord I beseech thee, open his eyes that he may see. Accordingly the Lord opened his eyes and he looked and lo! the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And as the Syrians were coming down upon him Elisha prayed to the Lord and said, Smite I pray thee, this people with dimness of sight. And when he had smitten them with dimness of sight, according to the word of Elisha,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Elisha said to them, This is not the city; nor this the way. Come, follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom you are seeking.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>So he led them away to Samaria; and when they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, Open, Lord, I beseech thee, their eyes, and let them see. So he opened their eyes and looked, and behold they were in the midst of Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, My father, shall I smite them?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>To which he replied, Thou must not smite them. Dost thou smite any but those whom thou hast captivated with thy own sword, or thy own bow? Set bread and water before them and let them eat and drink, and go to their lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>So he made a great entertainment for them. And when they had eaten and drunk he dismissed them, and they went to their master, and the predatory bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>After this, Son Ader king of Syria, assembled his whole army and came up and sat down before Samaria, and there was a great famine in Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>For behold they besieged it until an ass's head was sold for fifty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a kab of vetches for five shekels of silver.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him and said, Save me, my lord, king!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And the king said to her, Unless the Lord save thee, whence can I save thee, from the threshing floor or from the press?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Then the king said to her, What is the matter with thee? And the woman said, This woman said to me, Give thy son that we may eat him to-day; and we will eat my son to-morrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>So when we had boiled my son and eaten him, I said to her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat him; but she hath hidden her son.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>When the king of Israel heard the words of the woman he rent his clothes, as he was passing along on the wall, so that all the people saw the sackcloth underneath on his flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>And he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha shall stand on him this day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And when the king despatched a man before him; before the messenger came to him he said to the elders, Do you see that this son of a murderer hath sent to take off my head? Look! when the messenger cometh, shut the door and stop him there. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And while he was speaking with them, behold the messenger came down to him. And when the king said, Behold this calamity is from the Lord; why should I wait any longer for the Lord?</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Elisha replied, Hear a word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord, About this time to-morrow, a measure of fine flour for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Upon this a nobleman on whose hand the king leaned, in reply to Elisha said, Behold should the Lord make flood gates in heaven, can such a thing be? And Elisha replied, Behold thou shalt see it with thy eyes but shalt not eat thereof.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Now there were four lepers before the gate of the city, and one said to another, Why sit we here till we die?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>If we say, let us go into the city; there is a famine in the city and we must die there. And if we stay here we must die. Now therefore come, let us desert to the camp of Syria; if they take us alive we may live; and if they put us to death, we can but die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>So they arose when it was dark to go to the Syrian camp. But when they came to a part of the camp of Syria; behold there was not a man there.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For the Lord had caused the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, and the sound of a great army to be heard in the Syrian camp: whereupon they said one to another, Now hath the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Chettites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Therefore they arose and fled while it was dark. They left their tents and their horses and their asses in the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>So when the lepers came to a part of the camp they went into a tent and ate and drank, and carried thence silver and gold and raiment, and went away. And returning again they went into another tent and took things out of it and hid them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Then one said to another, We should not do so. This is a day of good news. Should we be silent and wait till the morning light, we shall incur guilt. Now therefore, come, let us go and inform the king's household.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Accordingly they came and cried with a loud voice at the gate of the city and told them the news, saying, We have been to the camp of Syria and behold there is not a man there, nor the sound of a man. For there is nothing there but the horses and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And when the watchmen at the gates cried and told the king's household within,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>the king arose and said to his servants, Let me tell you what Syria hath done to us. They know that we are famishing, therefore they have left their camp and hid themselves in the fields, saying, They will come out of the city and we shall take them alive and enter the city.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>To this one of his servants said in reply, Pray let them take five of the remaining horses which are left here, behold they are nearly all the multitude belonging to Israel which are left: and let us send thither and see.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>So they took two horsemen, and the king of Israel sent them after the king of Syria, saying, Go and see.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And they went on after them as far as the Jordan. And behold all the way was full of clothes and vessels, which the Syrians had thrown away in their panick fright. And when the messengers returned and told the king,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>the people went out and plundered the camp of Syria. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now the king had stationed at the gate the nobleman on whose hand he had leaned, but the people trode him down so that he died, according to the saying of the man of God, who spoke to him when the messenger came down to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For when Elisha spoke to the king, saying, two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, and this shall be about this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>this nobleman answered and said to Elisha, Behold should the Lord make flood gates in heaven, could this be? Thereupon Elisha said, Behold thou shalt see with thy eyes but shalt not eat thereof.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And so it fell out: For the people trampled him down at the gate, so that he died.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Elisha having spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise and go thou and thy family and sojourn where thou canst; for the Lord hath called for a famine against this land, and it is come upon the land for seven years;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>the woman arose and did according to the word of Elisha, and both she and her family sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And at the end of the seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines to the city, and went to apply to the king about her house and her fields.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now the king had spoken to Giezi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things which Elisha hath done.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And it happened that as he was relating how he had brought to life a son that was dead, behold the woman whose son Elisha had restored to life, applied to the king about her house and her fields. And Giezi said, My Lord the king! This is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Upon which the king inquired of the woman, and when she told him, the king appointed for her an officer, and said, Restore all that belonged to her, and all the produce of the fields from the day she left the land even to this day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>When Elisha went to Damascus, Son Ader king of Syria was sick. And when they told him, saying, The man of God is arrived here,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>the king said to Azael, Take in thy hand an offering, and go meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So Azael went to meet him, and took with him of all the good things of Damascus, forty camels' burden. And coming, he stood before Elisha, and said to him, Thy son, Son Ader king of Syria, hath sent me to thee to inquire, saying, Shall I recover of this disease of mine?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And Elisha said, Go say, Thou shalt be in vigour of life as the Lord hath shewn me, when thou by death shalt die.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Then he stood with his eyes fixed on the countenance of Azael, and kept them fixed till he blushed. And the man of God wept.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Whereupon Azael said, Why doth my lord weep? To which he replied, Because I know all the evils which thou wilt do to the children of Israel. Their fortresses thou wilt demolish with fire; their chosen men thou wilt slay with the sword. Thou wilt dash to pieces their infants, and rip up their women with child.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>At this Azael said, Who is thy servant! a dead dog! that I should do such a thing? And Elisha said, To me the Lord hath pointed thee out reigning over Syria.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Then he departed from Elisha, and went to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? To which he replied, He said thou shalt be in vigour of life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And on the next day he took a napkin, and having dipped it in water, he spread it over his face, so that he died. And Azael reigned in his stead.</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>In the fifth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel, while Josaphat reigned over Juda, Joram son of Josaphat began to reign as king of Juda.</content>

      <content>He was thirty two years of age when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>and walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab did, for he had for his wife a daughter of Achab. But though he did evil in the sight of the Lord,</content>

    <verse num="19">
      <content>yet the Lord would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake; as he had promised to give a lamp to him, and his children forever.</content>

      <content>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and made a king over themselves.</content>

      <content>and Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda even to this day. At the same time Lobna also revolted.</content>
