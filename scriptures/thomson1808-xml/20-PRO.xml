      <content>The Proverbs of David's son Solomon, who reigned over Israel,</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>to give a knowledge of wisdom and instruction; the perception of the words of prudence;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>the interpretation of sentences; a discernment of true justice; and to direct judgment,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>that he might give sagacity to the innocent; and to the youth knowledge and discretion:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>for by attending to them a wise man will become wiser; and a man of understanding will possess a rule of government</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>and will understand a proverb and dark speech and the sayings of the wise and parables.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And all who practise this have good understanding. And piety towards God is the beginning of discernment: but the wicked despise wisdom and instruction.</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>My son, hear the instruction of thy father and reject not the maxims of thy mother:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>for thou wilt receive a graceful crown for thy head; and a chain of gold for thy neck.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>My son, let not wicked men lead thee astray. Consent not when they advise thee,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>saying, Come with us; partake of blood; and let us hide in the earth an innocent man without cause,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>and swallow him up alive, as the grave, and take away from earth the remembrance of him.</content>

    <verse num="13">
      <content>Let us seize his precious substance and fill our houses with spoils.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Cast in thy lot among us, and let us all have a common purse. Let one scrip serve us.</content>

    <verse num="17">
      <content>For nets are not spread for birds unjustly.</content>

    <verse num="18">
      <content>For they who are accomplices to murder, treasure up evils for themselves. And doleful is the destruction of wicked men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Such are the ways of all who commit iniquitous deeds. For by wickedness they destroy their own soul.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>Wisdom uttereth her song at the gates and in the streets speaketh boldly;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>and on the tops of walls she maketh proclamation; and at the gates of mighty men taketh a seat and at the gates of a city with confidence saith,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>While the innocent adhere to justice they shall not be put to shame: but as for fools who delight in mischief, having become wicked they hated knowledge and are become liable to censures.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Behold I will pour forth to you the dictate of my spirit: and teach you this word of mine;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>seeing I have called and you have not answered: and though I continued my speech, you did not attend:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>but set at naught my counsels and disregarded my reproofs:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>therefore I will laugh at your calamity; and mock when your destruction cometh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Yes, when tumult shall suddenly come upon you; and destruction like a whirlwind shall be at hand; even when tribulation and siege approach you; or when destruction is advancing upon you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>For when you call upon me I will not listen to you. The wicked may seek me, but they shall not find me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>For they hated wisdom and did not chuse the word of the Lord:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>nor would they attend to my counsels, but contemned my reproofs:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Let them eat, therefore, the fruits of their own way; and be filled with their own iniquity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>For, because they wronged infants they shall be slain: and a rigorous inquest shall destroy the wicked.</content>

      <content>But he who hearkeneth to me shall dwell with hope; and rest secure from all evil.</content>

      <content>then thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord; and find the knowledge of God.</content>

      <content>Alas for them who leave straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness;</content>

      <content>whose ways are crooked, and whose paths turn aside to lead thee far from the straight road</content>

    <verse num="16">
      <content>and estrange thee from a just determination.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>My son, let not evil counsel, who hath forsaken the discipline of youth and hath forgotten the divine covenant, take hold of thee.</content>
