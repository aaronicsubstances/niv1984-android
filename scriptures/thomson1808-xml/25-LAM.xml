    <verse num="1">
      <content>After Israel was carried into captivity, and Jerusalem was laid waste; Jeremias sat down and wept, and sung this song of woe over Jerusalem, and said. How solitary sitteth the city which was full of people! she who was abundant among nations is become like a widow! the empress of provinces is become tributary!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>She wept sore by night and her tears are on her cheeks: and of all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends dealt treacherously with her. They became her enemies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Judea is forced to emigrate. On account of her humiliation and because of her great servitude, she sat down among the nations; she found no rest. All her persecutors found her among them who were afflicting her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>The highways of Sion mourn; because none attend her festivals. All her gates are desolate. Her priests groan bitterly. Her virgins are carried away; and she is by herself in bitterness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>They who afflict her are become her head; and her enemies prosper. Because the Lord hath humbled her for the multitude of her transgressions; her children are gone into captivity before the oppressor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>From the daughter of Sion all her comeliness is taken away. Her chiefs were like rams which could find no pasture; and they came without strength in view of the pursuer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>In the days of her humiliation and rejection, Jerusalem remembered all the good things which she had in days of old. When her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her; her enemies seeing this, laughed at her festivals held in commemoration of her settlement.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Jerusalem sinned grievously, therefore she became unstable as a wave. By all that honoured her she hath been humbled, for they saw her nakedness, while she sighing turned away her face.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Her unclean ness was before her feet. She was insensible to her extreme distress. He hath indeed lowered her haughtiness; there is none who comforteth her. Lord, behold my affliction because the enemy is magnified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>On all the objects of her desire the oppressor hath laid his hand; for into her sanctuary she saw nations entering, concerning whom thou hast commanded that they should not come into thy congregation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>All her people were sighing deeply, seeking bread. They gave up the objects of her desire, for meat to preserve life. Look down, O Lord, and see how she is dishonoured.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Ho! all ye who travel the way turn and see! is there any sorrow like this of mine, which he hath denounced against me. The Lord hath humbled me in the day of his fierce indignation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>From his loftiness he hath sent a fire; he brought it in among my bones. He hath spread a net for my feet and turned me backwards. He hath made me desolate and full of sorrow, all the live long day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>He hath kept a watch on my transgressions. They are wreathed round my hands. They have reached up to my neck. My strength is enfeebled. For into my hands the Lord hath sent pains. I cannot stand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>From amidst me the Lord hath moved all my mighty men. He hath brought upon me the time for crushing my chosen bands. The Lord trod out a vat for the virgin daughter of Juda.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For these things I mourn. Mine eye hath flowed with water, because my comforter, he who is the supporter of my life, is far removed from me. My children are vanished because the enemy hath prevailed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Sion stretched forth her hand; there is none to comfort her. The Lord gave a command respecting Jacob; around him are they who afflict him. Jerusalem became among them, like one set apart as unclean.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>The Lord is righteous; for against his express commandment I rebelled. Hear I beseech you all ye peoples and behold my sorrow! my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>I called on my lovers; but they with false excuses deceived me. My priests and my elders expired in the city, because they sought food to support their lives, but found none.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Look, O Lord! because of my distress my bowels are troubled; and my heart within me is distracted, because I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword, and at home death have bereaved me of children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Hear, I beseech thee! because I groan; there is none to comfort me. All mine enemies heard of my calamities, and rejoiced at what thou hast done. Thou hast brought on a day: thou hast proclaimed a time. They were like me,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>let all their wickedness come before thee. Make search for them as they have made search for all my transgressions. For my groans are many, and my heart is afflicted with grief.</content>
    </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Oh! how the Lord hath in his wrath covered with darkness the daughter of Sion! he hath cast down, from heaven, upon the earth, the glory of Israel; and hath not remembered his own footstool.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>In the day of his indignation the Lord overwhelmed and did not spare; in his wrath he destroyed all the comeliness of Jacob: he levelled to the ground the strong holds of the daughter of Juda. He brought contempt on her king, and her chiefs.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>In his fierce anger he broke the whole horn of Israel: he turned back his right hand from before his enemy: he kindled in Jacob a flaming fire, which devoured all around.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>He bent his bow like an opposing enemy; like an adversary he strengthened his right hand and slew all the desires of mine eyes. In the tent of the daughter of Sion he poured out his wrath like fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>The Lord became like an enemy. He overwhelmed Israel. He sunk her palaces. He destroyed his own munitions, and multiplied on the daughter of Juda humiliation on humiliation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>He laid open like a vineyard his own dwelling; he marred his own festivals. The Lord forgot the festivals and sabbaths which he had established in Sion, and by the rebuke of his anger vexed king and priest and chief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>The Lord hath cast off his altar; he hath shaken off his sanctuary. With the hand of an enemy he hath demolished the wall of her palaces. They uttered a shout in the house of the Lord as on the day of a festival.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>He turned back to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion; he stretched out a measuring line: he withdrew not his hand from destruction; so the outer wall mourned and the inner wall languished with it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Her gates were dashed to the ground: he destroyed and broke to pieces her bars, her king and her chiefs among the nations. Law is no more; and her prophets saw not a vision from the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>The elders of the daughter of Sion sat on the ground. They were silent. They heaped dust on their heads; they girded themselves with sackcloth. He humbled to the ground the virgin princesses in Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Mine eyes failed with tears; my heart was astounded. My glory was poured on the ground for the distress of the daughter of my people when the infant and suckling expired in the streets of the city.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>To their mothers they said, Where is corn and wine, when they were fainting like wounded men in the streets of the city; when they were pouring out their souls in their mothers' bosom.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>What shall I take to witness for thee? Or to what shall I liken thee, daughter of Jerusalem? Who can save and comfort thee, virgin daughter of Sion? Because thy cup of ruin hath been large, who can heal thee?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Thy prophets saw vanities and follies for thee; they made no revelations against thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity, but saw for thee false burdens and expellings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>All that passed by clapped their hands for thee, they expressed the sound of pity and shaked their heads for the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this, say they, the city, the crown of joy of the whole earth!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Against thee all thine enemies opened their mouth; they hissed and gnashed their teeth and said, We have swallowed her up; but this is the day we looked for; we have found it; we have seen it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>The Lord hath done what he purposed. He hath executed his decree, what he enjoined in days of old. He hath destroyed and hath not spared. He hath caused an enemy to rejoice over thee. He hath exalted the horn of thine oppressor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Their heart cried to the Lord.! walls of Sion cause tears to flow down like a torrent day and night. Give thyself no rest; let not the daughter of thine eyes be silent.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Arise, chant praise in the night at setting thy watch. Pour out thy heart like water before the Lord; lift up thy hands to him for the life of thine infants, who are perishing with hunger at the head of every street.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Look, O Lord, and see. For whom hast thou caused such a search to be made? Shall women eat the fruit of their womb! The cook hath made search! Shall infants at the breast be butchered? Wilt thou slay in the sanctuary of the Lord, priest and prophet?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>On the high way lie the youth and the elder. My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity; with sword and with famine thou hast slain; in the day of thine anger thou hast slaughtered and hast not spared.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>He called my sojourners from all around to a solemn festival, so that in the day of the indignation of the Lord none escaped or were left. As I excelled in power so have I multiplied all mine enemies.</content>

      <content>I am a man who have seen affliction by the rod of his wrath</content>
    </verse>

      <content>against me. He hath seized me and dragged me into darkness and there is no light.</content>

      <content>But still he turned his hand against me all the day long.</content>
