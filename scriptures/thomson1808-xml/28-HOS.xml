    <verse num="1">
      <content>A word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Ozias and Joatham and Achaz and Ezekias kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas king of Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea. When the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take thee a wife of whoredom, and children of whoredoms, since the land is going and will go a whoring from the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>He then went and took Gomer a daughter of Debelaim: and when she conceived and bore him a son,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Jehu, and cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And it shall come to pass in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And when she conceived again and bore a daughter, he said to him, Call her name, Not compassionated; for I will no longer continue to have compassion on the house of Israel, but will set myself against them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>But on the children of Juda I will have compassion and I will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And when she had weaned Not compassionated, she conceived again and bore a son,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and he said, Call his name Not my people, since you are not my people and I am not your God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>(Now the number of the children of Israel was like the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor counted.) But it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, they shall be called children of the Living God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>and the children of Juda and the children of Israel shall be gathered together and shall appoint for themselves one head and come up out of the land. Because great will be the day of Jezrael;</content>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>say ye to your brother, My people, and to your sister, Compassionated;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>emplead your mother, emplead, because with regard to her, is she not my wife? And as for me, am not I her husband? Therefore I will remove her fornication from before me and her adultery from between her breasts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>That I may do this I will strip her naked, and reduce her to the state she was in at her birth. I will indeed make her desolate, and order her to a land without water and kill her with thirst,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>and on her children I will not have compassion. Because they are children of fornication;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>because their mother hath committed whoredom; she, who brought them forth hath acted shamefully; because she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, and my apparel and my fine linens, mine oil and all things convenient for me;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>for this behold I will hedge up her way with thorns; and block up her ways that she may not find her path.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Though she follow her lovers she shall not overtake them; though she seek them, she shall not find them. Then she will say, I will go and return to my former husband, for it was then better with me than now.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>She indeed did not acknowledge that I gave her the corn and wine and oil; and multiplied silver for her: but she made ornaments of gold and silver for Baal:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>therefore I will turn and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its appointed time; and I will take away my garments and my fine linens, that she may not cover her nakedness:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>and I will now disclose her impurity before her lovers; and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>I will indeed turn away all her pleasures, her festivals, and her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn assemblies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And I will lay waste her vineyards and her fig orchards; all those things respecting which she said, these are my rewards which my lovers gave me; and I will make them for a memorial; and the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the air, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And I will punish her for the days of the baleims in which she sacrificed to them. when she had put on her ear rings and her jewels, she went after her lovers and forgot me, saith the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>therefore behold I will cause her to wander, and order her to a wilderness and speak to her heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And thence I will give her for her possessions, even the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be humbled there as in the days of her youth, even as in the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that she will call me My husband; and no more call me Baalim.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>I will indeed take away the names of the Baalims out of her mouth, and their names shall no more be mentioned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And in that day I will make a covenant for them, with the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the reptiles of the earth; and bow and sword and battle I will crush out of the land; and I will settle thee securely</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>and betroth thee to myself forever. I will indeed betroth thee to myself by righteousness and by judgment and by compassion and by tender mercies:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>and I will betroth thee to myself by fidelity; and thou shalt acknowledge the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will hearken to the heaven, and it shall hearken to the earth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil, and they shall hearken to Jezrael;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and I will plant her for myself in the land, and love her who was not beloved; and to them who were not my people I will say, Thou art my people: and they will say, Thou the Lord art my God.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Again the Lord said to me, Still go and love a woman who loveth wickedness, even an adulteress, as God loveth the children of Israel, though they look to strange gods and love cakes with dried grapes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>So I hired one for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a gomar of barley and a nebel of wine,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>and said to her, Thou shalt continue many days for me and shalt not play the harlot nor have commerce with man, then I will be for thee;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>for the children of Israel shall continue many days without a king and without a chief, and without a sacrifice and without an altar and without a priesthood, and without manifestations;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>and afterwards the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and will be amazed at the Lord and at his goodness in the last days.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Hear a word of the Lord, children of Israel! the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of this land; because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Cursing and lying and murder and theft and adultery are burst out on the land, and blood mingleth with blood;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>therefore the land shall mourn and be wasted with all its inhabitants, with the wild beasts of the fields and with the reptiles of the earth, and with the birds of the air. Even the fishes of the sea shall fail.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>In order that none may be judged, that none may reprove, this people of mine shall be like a contradicted priest, (Jehovah. The prophet speaks.)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>and shall be weak for years; and with thee the prophet shall be without strength. I have compared thy mother to the night:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>my people is like one that hath not knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, therefore I will reject thee from being my priest: as thou hast forgotten the law of thy God; I also will forget thy children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>In proportion to their increase they sinned against me; I will turn their glory into shame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Shall they eat the sin offerings of my people and by their iniquities support their lives?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>It shall indeed be that as is the people so shall be the priest; I will punish them for their ways and retribute to him his devices.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Though they eat they shall not be filled, they have committed fornications, and they cannot prosper. Because they forsook the Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>to attend to fornication and wine, therefore the heart of my people embraced drunkenness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>They consulted by symbols and gave them answers by their staves. By a spirit of fornication they were led astray; and they went a whoring from their God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>They sacrificed on the tops of the mountains, and on the hills they burned incense, under an oak and a beech and a shady tree, because shade is good. For this cause your daughters will commit whoredom and your wives adultery;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>and I will not punish your daughters, when they commit whoredom, nor your daughters in law when they commit adultery. Because they conversed with harlots and sacrificed with prostitutes, therefore my people, who were without understanding, were entangled with fornication.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>As for thee, Israel, continue not in ignorance; and thou Juda go not to Galgala. Either go not up to the house of On, or swear not by the living Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Because Israel ran about madly like a heifer stung by a gad fly, the Lord will now feed them like a lamb in a roomy place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Ephraim associating with idols, laid stumbling blocks for himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>They addicted themselves to the Chananites; they went on in a continued course of whoredom; they loved dishonour because of its revelry;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>thou art a whirl of wind in its wings; but they shall be put to shame because of their altars.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Hear these things ye priests; and attend ye house of Israel, and ye household of the king give ear; for against you is this indictment, because you are become a snare in the watch tower; and like a net spread upon Itaburion,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>which they who hunt wild beasts have fixed up. As for me, I was your instructor;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>I acknowledged Ephraim, when Israel did not withdraw from me. Now because Ephraim went a whoring, Israel is polluted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>They did not apply their thoughts to return to their God. Because there is a spirit of whoredom in them, and they have not acknowledged the Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>therefore the haughtiness of Israel shall be humbled at his presence, and Israel and Ephraim shall be weakened for their iniquities. When Juda also shall be weakened with them,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>they will go with sheep and young bulls to seek the Lord, but they shall not find him, because he hath withdrawn from them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Because they have forsaken the Lord, because strange children have been born to them: the canker Worm shall now devour them and their portions.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Sound a trumpet on the mounts; raise a shout on the high places; proclaim in the house of On, Benjamin is confounded.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Ephraim is become a desolation in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I have given faithful warnings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>The chiefs of Juda are become like the removers of boundaries, upon them I will pour out my fury like water.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Ephraim tyrannised over his adversary, he trampled down judgment; because he set the example of going after vanities,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>therefore I will be like a terror to Ephraim, and like a goad to the house of Juda.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>When Ephraim saw his disorder and Juda felt his pain, though Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to king Iarim; yet he could not heal you, nor could your pain be assuaged;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>for I am like a panther to Ephraim, and like a lion to the house of Juda. When I tear, I will go and take and there shall be no deliverer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>I will sally forth and return to my place until they are made desolate, then they will seek my face.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>In their affliction they will seek me early, saying, Come, let us return to the Lord our God, for it is he who hath torn and he can heal us. He can smite, and into our wounds he can pour balm;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>in two days he can restore us to health; on the third day we shall be raised up and live before him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Let us acknowledge; let us continue our pursuit to know the Lord; sure as the morning we shall find him. He will come like rain for us; like the former and latter rain for the earth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>What shall I do for thee, Ephraim? What shall I do for thee, Juda? As for your goodness, it was like a morning cloud; like the transient dew of the morning:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>for this cause I mowed down your prophets, I slew them with the word of my mouth, and my judgment shall go forth as light;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>for I desire mercy rather than sacrifice, and an acknowledgment of God rather than whole burnt offerings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>As for them, they are like man transgressing a covenant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>There the city Galaad hath contemned me; it is a framer of vanities, a troubler of water,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and thy strength was that of a mighty robber. The priests concealed the way; they acted the murder at Sikima. Because they committed iniquity in the house of Israel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>I saw there the horrible fornication of Ephraim. Israel is polluted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now Juda begin an ingathering for thyself. When I bring back the captivity of my people.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>When I have healed Israel, then shall be disclosed the iniquity of Ephraim and the wickedness of Samaria. Because they have framed lies, therefore a thief shall come in to him, a sculking robber shall be in his way:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>that they may chime together like them who sing in unison. I remembered all their wickedness, now their own devices have encompassed them. They were all open to my view.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>They made kings glad by their wickedness and chiefs by their lies.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>They all burn with adultery, like an oven for baking cakes, which, after putting in the fire, after mixing the dough, is kept burning, till the dough is leavened.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>With regard to the days of your kings, the chiefs had begun to be inflamed with wine. He had stretched forth his hand with turbulent men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Because their hearts were heated like an oven, when they had revelled the whole night, Ephraim fell fast asleep. The morning came, he was heated again like a flaming fire.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>They were all hot as an oven and devoured their judges; all their kings fell; there was none among them who appealed to me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Ephraim was mingled among his tribes; Ephraim was a cake under ashes, which had not been turned.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Strangers devoured his strength and he did not know it; grey hairs grew upon him and he did not perceive it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Though it was evident that the haughtiness of Israel would be humbled, yet they did not turn to the Lord their God, nor seek him diligently for all this.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Ephraim indeed was like a silly dove which had no understanding; he called upon Egypt: and they went to the Assyrians.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Let them go where they will, I will spread my net for them, and bring them down like the birds of the air, and instruct them with the report of one another's affliction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Alas! for them, because they have departed from me. They are faint hearted, because they have transgressed against me. Though I redeemed them, yet they spoke lies against me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Their hearts do not cry to me; but only make moans on their beds; for corn and wine they were deeply affected.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>By me they were instructed; I indeed strengthened their arms; but they devised evils against me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>They were turned back to no purpose. They were like a bended bow. Let their chiefs fall by the sword for the folly of their tongue; let the derision they endured in the land of Egypt come into their bosoms like dirt, like an eagle darting upon the house of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>will they cry to me, God, we have known thee?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Because Israel turned away good things they met with an enemy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>They made kings for themselves but not by me; they set up a government and did not consult me; of their silver and gold they made idols for themselves that they might be utterly cut off.</content>

      <content>Away with thy calf, Samaria! my wrath is kindled against them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>How long shall things which cannot be made clean be in Israel? A carpenter made it; it is no God. Because thy calf, Samaria, was an imposture;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>because they sowed blasted seed, therefore the catastrophe was correspondent; there is not a handful capable of yielding meal. And had it succeeded, strangers would have devoured it.</content>

    <verse num="8">
      <content>Israel is swallowed up; he is now among the nations like an useless vessel,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>because he went up to the Assyrians. While Ephraim continued at home he sprouted again. They loved gifts,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>therefore they shall be delivered up to the nations. I will now take charge of them, and they shall cease a little while from anointing a king and chiefs.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Because Ephraim multiplied altars for sins; altars were to him objects of love;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>I will prescribe for him a multitude. Though his rites were devised for other purposes, the altars were objects of love.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For what purpose soever they offer sacrifices and eat flesh, the Lord will not accept them; he will now remember their iniquities and punish their sins. They turned back to Egypt, therefore among the Assyrians they shall eat unclean things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Israel indeed forgot his Maker and built fanes, and Juda multiplied fenced cities; but into these cities of his I will send a fire, and it shall devour those buildings of theirs.</content>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Rejoice not, Israel; nor be elated like the tribes, because thou hast gone a whoring from thy God. Thou didst love gifts on every corn floor;</content>

      <content>floor and press have disowned them, and the wine hath disappointed them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>They did not dwell in the land of the Lord: Ephraim became an inhabitant of Egypt; therefore among the Assyrians they shall eat unclean things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>They did not pour out wine to the Lord nor offer him sweet incense; their sacrifices shall be to them like the bread of affliction; all that eat thereof shall be polluted. Seeing their funeral loaves cannot come into the house of the Lord,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>what will you do on the day of a solemn assembly; and on a day of a festival of the Lord?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For this cause behold they are going from the misery of Egypt, and Memphis shall receive them and Machmas shall bury them. As for their silver, destruction shall inherit it. Thorns shall be in their habitations.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>The days of the visitation are come; at hand are the days of thy recompence: and Israel shall be afflicted like the prophet who was struck with horror; the man who had been inspired. By the multitude of thine iniquities thy madness was increased.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Ephraim was a watchman with God, a prophet was a cunning snare in all his ways, they had fixed a madness by a house of God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>they were corrupt as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; he will punish their sins.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>I found Israel as a bunch of grapes in a wilderness; and I saw their fathers like an early watcher in a fig orchard. They went to Belphagor and abandoned themselves to shame, and became abominable, compared with the beloved.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Ephraim is flown like a bird; their glories from parentage, births and conceptions are gone.</content>

      <content>Ephraim, as I have seen, have roused their children for a hunt; even Ephraim hath, that he may lead out his children to a fatal conflict.</content>
