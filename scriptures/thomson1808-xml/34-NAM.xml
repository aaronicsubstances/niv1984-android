      <content>The sentence on Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum, the Elkosite.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>God is zealous. The Lord is about to take vengeance: the Lord is about to take vengeance with wrath: the Lord is about to take vengeance on his adversaries, and to destroy utterly his enemies, himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>The Lord is slow to anger, though his power is great; will not the Lord then acquit the innocent? Is his way in destruction and whirlwind, when clouds are the dust of his feet? (An objection, The answer)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>When he rebuketh the sea he maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel are diminished and the bloom of Libanus languished.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>At him the mountains quake and the hills tremble; at his presence the earth is startled; the world and all its inhabitants.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>At the presence of his wrath who can stand, or who can resist his fierce indignation? His wrath dissolveth governments, and by him the rocks are rent to pieces.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>The Lord is kind to them who wait for him in a day of distress: and he knoweth them who reverence him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>When with a deluging march he maketh destruction; them who raise themselves up and are his enemies, darkness shall pursue.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>What are you devising against the Lord? He will make complete destruction, and not punish twice by distress for the same thing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Because one shall be utterly destroyed, and consumed like bindweed and dry stubble;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>shall a reasoning against the Lord proceed from thee; wicked city, devising things in opposition?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Thus saith the Lord, With respect to the ruler of many waters! they shall be so dispersed, that what thou hearest shall be heard no more.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>I will now break his sceptre from thee, and burst the bands asunder.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Concerning thee the Lord will command, let none of thy name be sown any more. From the house of thy God I will root out the graven and molten images; I will make it a sepulchre for thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Because yonder on the mountain are the swift feet of one bringing good news: even of one announcing peace; O Juda, solemnize thy festivals; pay thy vows; for they shall no more proceed to pass through thee for conflict. It is completely laid waste, entirely removed.</content>
    </verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Into thy presence came up panting one who is delivered from affliction. Watch the way; strengthen thy loins; act manfully with all thy might,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>since the Lord hath averted contumely from Jacob, as he did reproach from Israel, since emptiers have emptied them out and destroyed their branches;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>the instruments of their tyranny from among men; their mighty men insulting with fire. In the day of his preparation the reins of their chariots, and the horsemen will be disordered in their ranks;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>and the chariots will justle together and be entangled with one another in the streets. The appearance of them is like flaming torches and like streamy lightning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Their grandees will recollect and flee by day; but they shall be weak in their march. While they shall be hasting to her walls, and preparing their out guards;</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>And the empress herself is exposed to view; even she herself is gone up, and her maids are led along cooing plaintively like doves, in their hearts.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>As for Ninive, her waters are like a standing pool. They who fled away made no halt, nor was there one who looked back.</content>
    </verse>

    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>What quaking and driving! what groans and heart breaking! what feebleness of knees and pangs in every loin! what blackness, like that of a pot, on the countenance of all!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>where is the habitation of the lions, and the feeding places of the young lions? Where had the old lions gone, that a young lion entered and there was none to scare him?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>The old lion had seized enough for his whelps, and had strangled for his lionesses, and had filled his hole with prey, and his den with ravin:</content>

      <content>so that every one who seeth thee shall go down from thee, and say, Wretched Ninive! who can bemoan her? Whence can I find comfort for her?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Prepare a funeral cake! attune the lyre! prepare the funeral cake of Ammon! she dwelt among rivers; water was around her. The sea was her dominions, and water, her walls,</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Yet she is to go captive into banishment; and her infants shall be dashed to the ground at the head of all the streets); and for all her splendid treasures lots shall be cast; and all her grandees shall be bound with fetters.</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>thy shepherds slumbered; an Assyrian king lulled to sleep thy mighty men: thy people fled to the mountains and there was none to rally them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>There is no cure for thy bruise. Thy wound is festered. All that hear the news of thee will clap their hands at thee. For upon whom hath not thy wickedness come continually?</content>
