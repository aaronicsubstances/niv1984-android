    <verse num="1">
      <content>Whereas many have undertaken to compose a history of those things which have been accomplished among us,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>as they who were from the beginning eye witnesses, and are ministers of the word, have delivered them to us;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>it seemed good to me. also, when I had accurately traced every thing from the very first, immediately afterwards to write to thee, most excellent Theophilus,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>that thou mayst know the certainty of those doctrines in which thou hast been instructed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was of the race of Aaron.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and precepts of the Lord, without blame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now they had no child, as Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced in years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And it came to pass that when he was performing the priest's office before God, in the order of his course,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>it fell to his lot, according to the order of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord, to burn incense,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>while the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of the incense offering.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>at the sight of whom Zacharias was greatly discomposed and terrified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Whereupon the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife, Elizabeth, will bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>He will indeed be to thee matter of joy and exultation; and many will rejoice at his birth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must not drink wine, nor any fermented liquor. With a holy spirit he will be filled, even from his mother's womb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>He will go before in his presence, with the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and prepare disobedient persons, by a deep sense of righteous things, to be for the Lord a well disposed people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Thereupon Zacharias said to the angel, How can I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>In reply to which, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God: and I am sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee these glad tidings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now, behold, thou shalt be dumb and unable to speak, until the day when these tidings shall be accomplished; because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be confirmed in their season.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondered at his tarrying so long in the temple.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And when he came out, he could not speak to them. So they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he made signs to them and continued deaf and dumb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>And after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived; and kept herself retired five months, saying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>The Lord hath dealt thus with me in the days in which he looked on me to take away my reproach among men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And in the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>to a virgin contracted to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And when the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favourite of heaven! The Lord is with thee! Blessed thou among women!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Upon seeing him she was greatly discomposed at his speech, and revolved in her mind what sort of a salutation this might be.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>Whereupon the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary. For thou hast found favour with God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Now behold thou shall conceive, and bear a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>He will be great and will be called the son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I know not man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And the angel answering, said to her, A holy spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee, therefore the holy offspring will be called the son of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>Now behold Elizabeth thy cousin, even she hath conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her, who hath been called barren.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>For with God nothing is impossible.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>Thereupon Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to thy word.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And the angel left her. And in those days Mary set out and travelled with speed to the hill country, to a city of Juda,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>and went to the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And soon as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb: and Elizabeth was filled with a holy spirit,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>and with a loud acclamation said, Blessed thou among women! and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>How have I this honour, that the mother of my Lord should come to me!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>For behold! soon as the sound of thy salutation reached mine ear, the babe within me leaped for joy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>Happy indeed is she who believed that there shall be an accomplishment of the things spoken to her from the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>Then Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>and my spirit exulteth in God, my Saviour:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>because he hath regarded the low condition of his handmaid. For behold! henceforth all generations will call me happy.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>Because the Mighty One hath done great things for me; therefore hallowed be his name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>Indeed his mercy on them who fear him, extendeth to generations of generations.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>With his arm he hath displayed strength. He hath scattered them who were elated with the imagination of their heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="52">
      <content>From thrones he hath hurled potentates, and exalted them of low degree.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and sent away the rich empty.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="54">
      <content>He hath supported his servant Israel, remembering (as he spoke to our fathers) mercy</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="55">
      <content>for Abraham and his seed forever.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="56">
      <content>And Mary abode with her about three months, and then returned home.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="57">
      <content>Now when the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she8 brought forth a son.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="58">
      <content>And her neighbours and her relations, hearing that the Lord had magnified his mercy to her, rejoiced with her.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="59">
      <content>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="60">
      <content>But his mother interposing, said, No. He shall be called John.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="61">
      <content>And they said to her, There is none among thy kindred who is called by that name.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="62">
      <content>Then they made signs to his father to know what he would have him called.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="63">
      <content>And he, having demanded a table book, wrote, saying, His name is John. At which they were all surprised.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="64">
      <content>And his mouth was immediately opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="65">
      <content>And all in the neighbourhood were struck with awe. And the fame of all these things spread through the whole hill country of Judea.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="66">
      <content>And all who heard laid them up in their mind, saying, What will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="67">
      <content>And Zacharias his father was filled with a holy spirit, and he prophesied, saying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="68">
      <content>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; because he hath visited and delivered his people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="69">
      <content>He indeed hath raised up for us a horn of salvation in the house of his servant David</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="70">
      <content>(as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets of old)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="71">
      <content>a deliverance from our enemies, and out of the hand of all who hate us</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="72">
      <content>in kindness to our fathers, and in remembrance of his holy covenant</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="73">
      <content>(as he sware to our father Abraham)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="74">
      <content>that he would grant us, that we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, may serve him without fear,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="75">
      <content>in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="76">
      <content>Now as for thee, child, thou shalt be called a prophet of the Most High; for thou shall go before in the presence of the Lord, to prepare his ways;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="77">
      <content>to give his people a knowledge of salvation, by a remission of their sins,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="78">
      <content>through the tender mercy of our God, by which the Anatole the day spring from on high hath visited us</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="79">
      <content>to give light to them who are sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet to the way of peace.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="80">
      <content>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of the manifestation of him to Israel.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now it happened in those days, that an edict came forth from Caesar Augustus, that this whole inhabited land should be enrolled.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>This was the first enrolment; it was made when Cyrenius was a governor of Syria;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>and all went to be enrolled, every one to his own city,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>and accordingly Joseph went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and patriarchal family of David,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>to be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was then great with child.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And while they were there, the time came that she should be delivered;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>and she brought forth her son, the first born, and swathed him, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the house appropriate to lodging.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Now in that country there were shepherds in the open fields tending their flocks by turns, during the night watches.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>And lo! an angel of the Lord stood by them; and a glory of the Lord shone around them; at which they were greatly affrighted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Whereupon the angel said to them, Be not afraid; for lo! I bring you glad tidings; matter of great joy, which it will be to all the people</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>That to you there is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And this will be the sign for you. You will find a babe swathed, lying in the manger.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Glory to God in the highest heaven! And on earth, peace! good will among men!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And as soon as the angels withdrew from them to heaven; the men; the shepherds said one to another, come, let us go to Bethlehem and see this which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So they went with all speed, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe that lay in the manger;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>and, having seen, they divulged what had been told them concerning this child.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And all that heard were amazed at the things which were told them by the shepherds.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her mind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, agreeably to what had been declared to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now when eight days were accomplished, at circumcising the child, he was named Jesus, the name which the angel had given him before he was conceived.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>And when the days of her purification were accomplished according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>as it is written in the law of the Lord, that every male, who is the first born of his mother, is to be accounted consecrate to the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is prescribed in the law of the Lord: a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>And behold there was at Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon. This man, being righteous and devout, was waiting for the consolation of Israel; and there was a holy spirit upon him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Now it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit, that he should not see death until he had seen the Christ of the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>and he had come by the spirit to the temple. And when the parents brought the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>Now, O Lord, thou dismissest thy servant in peace according to thy word,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>since mine eyes have seen that salvation of thine,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>which thou hast prepared in the sight of all peoples,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>a light to illuminate the nations; the glory of thy people Israel.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>And while Joseph and the mother of the child were wondering at the things spoken concerning him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold this child is destined for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel, and for an object of calumny</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>(yea, a sword will pass through thy soul also) so that the ill grounded reasoning of many hearts will be revealed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>There was also one Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser. She was far advanced in years. Having lived seven years with a husband from her virgin state,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>she was now a widow, about eighty four years old, who departed not from the temple, performing religious service, with fasting and prayers, night and day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>She coming up at that instant, did, in a responsive strain, give thanks to the Lord; and she spake of him to all those in Jerusalem who were expecting a deliverance.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and there was a divine gracefulness upon him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>Now his parents used to go up every year to Jerusalem at the festival of the passover.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>So when he was twelve years old, they having gone up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the festival,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>and finished the days; when they set out on their return, the child Jesus staid behind at Jerusalem. And neither Joseph nor his mother knew it;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>but supposing that he was in the company, they went a day's journey. Then they sought him among their relations and acquaintance;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>And after three days, they found him in the temple, silting in the midst of the teachers, and hearing them, and asking them questions.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding, and his answers;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>and they who saw him were amazed. And his mother said to him, Son, Why hast thou dealt thus with us? Behold thy father and I have been seeking thee with sorrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>Whereupon he said to them, Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be at my father's?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>But they did not comprehend the meaning of what he said to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and continued subject to them. And his mother kept all these things in her mind.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="52">
      <content>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</content>

      <content>Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea; and Herod, tetrarch of Galilee; and his brother Philip, tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis; and Lysanias, being tetrarch of Abilene</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>in the pontificate of Annas and Caiaphas, a word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,</content>

      <content>As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord: make the roads for him straight.</content>

      <content>Let every valley be filled up; and every mountain and hill levelled; and let the crooked be made a straight road, and the rough ways, smooth.</content>

      <content>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of this reformation: and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</content>

    <verse num="9">
      <content>Now, indeed, the axe is at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore which doth not produce good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.</content>

      <content>Then he addressed to the people this parable. A certain man planted a vineyard and let it to husbandmen, and went abroad for many seasons.</content>

      <content>Again he sent another servant; and him also they beat, and abused shamefully, and sent away empty.</content>

      <content>Again he sent a third, and this one they wounded and cast out.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son, the Beloved. Perhaps they will reverence him, when they see him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>So having, cast him out of the vineyard they slew him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>He will come and destroy those husbandmen and give the vineyard to others. Upon hearing this, they said, God forbid.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But he looking earnestly at them, said, What then is the meaning of this passage of scripture, The stone which the builders rejected was the very one for the head of the corner!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Whosoever falleth on this stone will be bruised; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Upon this the chief priests and the Scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, (but they were afraid of the people,) for they knew that he had spoken this parable with a view to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Therefore, having watched him diligently, they sent to him spies who should feign themselves to be righteous men, that they might lay hold of some word of his, in order to deliver him up to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>So they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou speakest and teachest uprightly, and that thou art not a respecter of persons, but teachest the way of God with truth.</content>

      <content>Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar, or is it not?</content>

      <content>Now there were seven brothers. And the first, having taken a wife, died childless.</content>

      <content>In the future state, therefore, whose wife of them is she, as she hath been married to all the seven?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>In reply to this, Jesus said to them, The children of this world marry and are given in marriage;</content>

      <content>Art thou the Christ? Tell us. Whereupon he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe me.</content>

      <content>Then the whole assembly arose and led him away to Pilate,</content>

    <verse num="2">
      <content>and began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Thereupon Pilate asked him, saying, Thou art the king of the Jews? And he, in reply, said to him, It is as thou sayest.</content>

      <content>Then Pilate said to the chief priests, and the people, I find nothing criminal in this man.</content>

      <content>But they were the more vehement, saying, He raiseth sedition among the people, teaching through all Judea, from Galilee, where he began, even to this place.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>When Pilate heard them mention Galilee, he asked, Is the man a Galilean?</content>

    <verse num="7">
      <content>And finding that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also at Jerusalem in those days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad; for he had long desired to see him. Because he had heard much of him, therefore he hoped to see some miracle done by him,</content>

      <content>and questioned him about many things. But Jesus made him no answer.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>So when the chief priests, and the Scribes had stood up, urging their accusations against him with much vehemence;</content>

      <content>And on that day Pilate and Herod became friends; for they had been before at enmity one with the other.</content>

      <content>Then Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers of the people,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>said to them, You have brought this man to me as one who perverteth the people. And behold, on examining him before you, I have found nothing criminal in this man, touching those things which you lay to his charge.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Neither indeed hath Herod: for I referred you to him. Now as it appears that nothing deserving death hath been done by him:</content>

      <content>shall I therefore, when I have chastised him, let him go?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now he was under a necessity of releasing one to them at every festival,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>so they with one consent cried out, saying, Away with this man and release to us Barabbas.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>This was a person who on account of an insurrection in the city, and for murder, had been committed to prison.</content>

    <verse num="20">
      <content>Pilate therefore addressed them again, being desirous to release Jesus.</content>

      <content>But they exclaimed, saying, Crucify him; Crucify him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But he said to them a third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found nothing in him deserving death. I will therefore chastise him and let him go.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>But they with loud clamours persisted in their demands that he should be crucified. So the clamours of them and of the chief priests prevailed,</content>

    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>and released to them the man who for sedition and murder had been thrown into prison, whom they demanded, and gave up Jesus to their will.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>And as they were leading him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and laid the cross on him, that he might carry it after Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>And a great multitude of the people followed him, among whom were many women, who beat their breasts, and bewailed him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Whereupon, Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me; but weep for yourselves and for your children;</content>

    <verse num="29">
      <content>for lo! days are coming in which they will say, Happy the barren, and the wombs which never bare, and the breasts which never gave suck.</content>

      <content>Then will they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us: and to the hills, Cover us.</content>

      <content>Whereupon Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. Then dividing his garments in shares they cast lots.</content>

      <content>And the soldiers also, coming and offering him vinegar, insulted him,</content>

      <content>saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.</content>

      <content>We indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our crimes. But this man hath done nothing amiss.</content>

      <content>at which they being terrified, and inclining their face to the ground, the men said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>He is not here; but is risen. Remember how he spake to you, while he was yet in Galilee,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>saying, The son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Then they remembered his words,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and having returned from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>But their words appeared to them like an idle tale, and they did not believe them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Peter indeed, starting up, ran to the sepulchre, and having stooped down, saw nothing but the linens lying there. Upon which he went away home, musing with astonishment on what had happened.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And behold, on that same day, two of them were travelling to a village called Emmaus, which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>and they conversed with each other on all these occurrences.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And while they were conversing and reasoning together, Jesus himself drew near and travelled along with them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>But their eyes were withheld from knowing him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>And he said to them, What matters are these about which you are conferring with one another on the road, and are sad?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Thereupon one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said to him, Art thou such a stranger in Jerusalem as not to know the things which have happened there in these days?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>And he said, What things? They answered him, Those respecting Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a great prophet, mighty in miracles and doctrine before God and all the people</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>how our chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and they have crucified him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now we were hoping that he is the person who would soon deliver Israel. But indeed with all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But again some women of our company have astonished us; having been at the sepulchre very early in the morning,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and not finding his body, they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Whereupon some of the men who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found matters just as the women said: but him they did not see.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>Then he said to them, O thoughtless, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>Then beginning with Moses and proceeding through all the prophets, he explained to them, by all those writings, the things concerning himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>And when they drew near to the village to which they were going, he seemed as intending to go farther.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>But they pressed him, saying, Stay with us; for it is towards evening. The day is far spent. So he went in to stay with them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>And when he was at table with them, he took the loaf, and blessed, and brake, and distributed to them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Whereupon their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he disappeared from them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="32">
      <content>Then they said to one another, Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, and while he expounded the scriptures to us?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="33">
      <content>Then rising up immediately, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those with them in a throng,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="34">
      <content>affirming that the Lord is indeed risen and hath appeared to Simon.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="35">
      <content>And they told the occurrences on the road, and how he became known to them by his breaking the loaf.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="36">
      <content>And while they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them; and saith to them, Peace be to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="37">
      <content>At which they were affrighted, and, being in terror, thought they saw a spirit;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="38">
      <content>he said to them, Why are you alarmed? And why do groundless surmises arise in your hearts?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="39">
      <content>View my hands and my feet; that it is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me have.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="40">
      <content>While saying this, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="41">
      <content>And as they were still diffident on account of their joy, and in amaze, he said to them, Have you any food here?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="42">
      <content>Thereupon they gave him a piece of broiled fish and part of a honey comb,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="43">
      <content>which he took and ate before them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="44">
      <content>Then he said to them, This is what I told you while I was yet with you, That all the things written concerning me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must needs be accomplished.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="45">
      <content>Then he opened their minds that they might understand the scriptures,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="46">
      <content>and he said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="47">
      <content>and that for his name reformation and remission of sins should be proclaimed to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="48">
      <content>Now you are witnesses of these things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="49">
      <content>And behold I will send upon you what my father promised. And as for you, reside ye in the city of Jerusalem until you are indued with power from on high.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="50">
      <content>After that he led them out to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="51">
      <content>and while he was blessing them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="52">
      <content>and they, having worshipped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="53">
      <content>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</content>
