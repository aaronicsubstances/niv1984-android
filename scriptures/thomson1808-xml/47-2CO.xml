    <verse num="1">
      <content>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the congregation of God which is at Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Favour be to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>who comforteth us in all our affliction, to the end that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves have been comforted by God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Because in proportion as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us, so by means of Christ our consolation also aboundeth;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>and whether we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectually wrought out by a patient enduring of the same sufferings which we suffer; or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>therefore our hope of you is stedfast, as we know, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so will you be also of the consolation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For we do not, brethren, wish you to be ignorant with respect to that affliction of ours which befel us in Asia; that we were exceedingly pressed beyond our strength, so that we had indeed no hopes of life;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>but had in ourselves the sentence of death, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will still deliver us,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>you joining the assistance of your prayers for us, that the favour granted to us for the sake of many may be acknowledged by many with thanksgiving on our behalf.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For this is the matter of our boasting; the testimony of our conscience, that with simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more especially towards you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For we write nothing to you but what you clearly understand or have acknowledged, and will, I hope, even to the end acknowledge,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>as some of you have acknowledged us, that we are your boast, as you indeed will be ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And in this confidence I purposed to come to you first, that you might have a second benefit;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>and through you to proceed on to Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come to you again, and be by you forwarded on to Judea.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Did I then, in purposing this, use fickleness? Or what I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there may be the yes, yes; and the no, no?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Now as God is faithful, our word to you was not yes and no.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>For the Son of God, namely Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by us namely by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yes and no; but by him hath been made yes.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>For all the promises of God are in him yes, and in him Amen, for glory to God through us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Now, he who keepeth us together with you firm for Christ, and anointed us, is God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>who hath sealed us, and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and I appeal to God, as a witness on my life, that with a view to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>not that we have dominion over your faith; but are joint promoters of your joy; for in this faith you have continued;</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>but I determined this with myself, that my coming again should not be the occasion of grief to you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if I grieve you, who is there to gladden me? None, but he whom I have made sorrowful:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>and I wrote to you for this 'very purpose, that, when I come, I may not have grief on account of them for whom I ought to rejoice; as I have a confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For in great affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know that overflowing love which I have for you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Now if any one hath occasioned grief, he hath grieved me only as a partner in it; that I may not continue a burden on you all;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>sufficient for such a one is the censure which hath been passed by the majority;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>so that, on the contrary, I rather wish you to forgive and comfort him, that such a one may not be overwhelmed with an excess of sorrow.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Therefore I intreat you to authorise love for him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For this was one purpose of my writing, that I might have this proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>And to whomsoever you forgive any thing, I do so too. For with regard to myself, if I have forgiven any one whatever any thing, I have forgiven him for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>that Satan may not get an advantage over us, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now when I came to Troas for the purpose of proclaiming the glad tidings of the Christ, though the Lord opened a door for me,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus; but taking leave of them, I set out for Macedonia.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But thanks be to God who causeth us always to triumph in the Christ, and who manifesteth by us, in every place, the odour of the knowledge of him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Because we are for God a strong odour of the Christ among them who are saved, and among them who perish</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>(to these indeed an odour of death for death, but to those an odour of life for life) who therefore is sufficient for this?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For we do not like the many, adulterate the word of God, but as men of sincerity, but as men of God, in the presence of God in Christ we speak.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Are we beginning again to commend ourselves to you? Do we only want, like certain persons, commendatory letters to you, or letters of recommendation from you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>You yourselves are our letter. It hath been written in our hearts; it is known and read by all men.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>You are shewn publickly because you are the letter of Christ which we make use of. It is written, not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Such is the confidence which we have through Christ in regard to God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>not that we are of ourselves sufficient to reckon any thing as proceeding from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>who hath qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant; not of letter but of spirit; for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>(Now if the ministration of death engraven in letters, on stones, was attended with such glory, that the children of Israel could not look steadily on the face of Moses, because of the temporary glory of his countenance;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>shall not the ministration of the spirit be much more attended with glory?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>For if that ministration of condemnation was attended with glory, much more doth this ministration of justification abound in glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For that indeed which was glorious, is in this respect not glorious because of this super-excellent glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For if that which was temporary was with glory, much more shall this which is permanent be attended with glory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Having therefore such a hope, we use great plainness of speech,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>and do not act as Moses. He put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel might not look stedfastly to the end of that which is abolished.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Their minds were indeed blinded, for even to this day that very veil at the reading of the old covenant remaineth. That which is abolished by Christ is not unveiled,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>but even at this day when Moses is read there is a veil upon their heart,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>but when ever it shall turn to the Lord that veil will be taken away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now the Lord is the spirit? And where the spirit of the Lord, is, there is liberty; and we all with an unveiled face viewing, as in a mirrour, the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord of spirit.</content>
    </verse>

      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Having therefore this ministration, as we have obtained mercy, we do not falter,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>but have renounced the secrets of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor dealing deceitfully with the word of God, but by the clear manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>If then these glad tidings of ours are veiled, they are veiled by those perishing things,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>with which the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the disbelieving, that the splendour of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is an image of God, may not shine upon them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Because it is God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who hath shined in our hearts, to give a lustre of the knowledge of the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>and we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may belong to God and not be from, us;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>we are pressed on every side, but not utterly crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>persecuted, but not quite forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in this body of ours.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For we, who are living, are continually delivered up to death on the account of Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in this frail flesh of ours.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>So that death is operative in us, and life in you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>But having the same spirit of belief as is mentioned in this portion of scripture, I believed, therefore I spake, we also believe and therefore we speak,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also by Jesus and present us with you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>For all this is for your sakes that the superabounding favour may make thanksgiving by many redound the more to the glory of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For this cause we do not faint: nay though this outer man of ours is wasted, yet the inner is renewed day by day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For this momentary and light affliction of ours is working out for us an eternal weight of glory, great beyond expression,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>while we are aiming not at things seen, but at things unseen; for the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are eternal.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For we know that when the earthly house of this dwelling of ours is dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, everlasting in the heavens.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For in this we groan, wishing earnestly to clothe ourselves with that house of ours; that heavenly habitation;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>for having indeed that on, we shall not be found naked.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For truly we who are in this dwelling do groan, being loaded with a burden, for which we do not wish to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Now it is God who hath worked us up to this, and who hath indeed given us the earnest of the spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Therefore we are always undaunted, (as we know that while we are dwelling in this body we are sojourning abroad from the Lord;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>(for we walk by faith and not by sight;)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>and go on undaunted (as we think it better for us to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord;)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and therefore make it the height of our ambition, whether staying or going, to be well pleasing to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of the Christ, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in this bodily state, whether good or evil.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, and are open to the view of God, and I hope that we have been open also to your conscience.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For we are not commending ourselves again to you but are giving you an occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may make use of it before those who boast in outward appearance and not in heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For if we have been transported beyond ourselves it is to God; and if we are sober, it is for you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For the love of the Christ urgeth us on, judging this, that if one died for all then indeed were they all dying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>and that he died for all to the end that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and was raised up for them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>So that henceforth we know no one after the flesh. Nay though we indeed knew Christ after the flesh, yet we now know him so no more.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>So that if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things are passed away, behold! all those things are made new.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And all this is of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given us the ministry of this reconciliation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>So because God was in Christ reconciling a world to himself, not reckoning to them their transgressions, and hath committed to us the word of this reconciliation,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>we therefore as ambassadors for Christ; as if God were exhorting by us, we, in behalf of Christ, intreat, Be reconciled to God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>for he hath made him who knew no sin, a sin offering for us, that by him we may be made the righteousness of God;</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>and cooperating with him, we also exhort you that it may not be in vain that you have received this favour of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For he saith, In an acceptable time I have hearkened to thee, And in a day of salvation helped thee. Behold now is an acceptable time! Behold now is a day of salvation; and this we do</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>giving no offence in any thing that the office may not be blamed;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>but approving ourselves in every respect as ministers of God, by great constancy in afflictions, in distresses, in straits,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>in purity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in gentleness, in a holy spirit, in undissembled love,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>in the word of truth, in the power of God, with the armour of righteousness on the right and left,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>in honour and dishonour, in evil report and good report, as deceivers, though we are true;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>as unknown, though well known; as dying, though behold we live; as chastened, yet not put to death;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>as sorrowful, yet still rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.</content>

    <verse num="11">
      <content>O Corinthians! Our mouth is opened to you; our heart is enlarged.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>You are not straightened by us, but you are straightened by your own affections.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>Now in return, I speak as to children, Be ye also enlarged.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Form no associations with unbelievers; for what fellowship is there between righteousness and unrighteousness? What communion hath light with darkness?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>What concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God hath said, Because I will dwell among them and walk about among them, and will be their God, and they shall be my people;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>therefore come out from among them and separate yourselves, saith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>and be to you a father, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</content>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Having therefore, beloved, these promises, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Receive us cordially. We have injured no one; we have corrupted no one; we have defrauded no one.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>I do not speak to condemn you; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live together.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>I use great freedom of speech to you. I have great boasting with regard to you. I am filled with comfort. I superabound with joy in all our affliction.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For when we arrived in Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted every way. Without were fightings; within, fears.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>But God who comforteth them who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>not barely however by his coming, but by the consolation with which he was comforted on your account, when he informed us of your longing desire, your bitter sorrow, your zeal for me; so that I was the more rejoiced;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>because if I grieved you by that letter, I have no cause to regret, though I did regret; for I find that that letter, though suitable to the occasion, made you sorry.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were affected with a sorrow which led to a reformation. For you were affected with a godly sorrow, that you might in no wise receive damage from us.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For godly sorrow operateth to produce a reformation for salvation, never to be repented of; but the sorrow of this world worketh death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For behold! this very thing; your being affected with a godly sorrow, what solicitude it hath wrought in you! nay, what apologies! what indignation! what fear! what longing desire! what zeal! what avengement! By your whole conduct you have shewn yourselves to be clear in this matter.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now though I indeed wrote to you, it was not on the account of him who had done the injury, nor of him who was injured, but that our solicitude, which we have for you, might be made manifest to you in the presence of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>We were therefore comforted for your comfort, and rejoiced the more exceedingly at the joy of Titus; because his spirit was refreshed by you all;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>so that if I boasted of you to him, I was not shamed; but as we spake all things to you with truth, so also our boast which we made to Titus hath been verified;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>and his affection for you increaseth more abundantly on recollecting the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>I rejoice therefore that I can wholly confide in you.</content>

      <content>We now, brethren, make known to you, the bounty of God which hath been granted by the congregations of Macedonia,</content>
