      <content>Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from the dead;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>and all the brethren with me, to the congregations of Galatia;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>favour be to you and peace from God the father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>to whom be the glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>I am astonished that you are so soon carried away, to another message of peace, from him who by the favour of Christ called you:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>which is owing to nothing but this, that there are some who trouble you, and wish to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>But if we, or an angel from heaven, proclaim to you as glad tidings any thing different from what we have proclaimed to you, let him be an anathema. As we said before,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>so I now say again, If any one teach you as glad tidings any thing different from what you have received, let him be anathema.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For do I now conciliate the favour of men rather than of God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now I certify to you, brethren, that the message of glad tidings which I proclaimed is not according to man;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>for I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it; but by revelation of Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For you have heard of my behaviour formerly in the Jewish religion; that I, in the most violent manner, persecuted the congregation of God, and ravaged it;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>and that I made a greater proficiency in Judaism than many fellow students of my age, in my own nation, being more abundantly a zealot for the doctrines of my fathers:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>but when it pleased God, who had set me apart from my birth, and by his special favour called me,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>to reveal his son to me, that I might proclaim the good tidings of him among the nations immediately; I did not consult flesh and blood,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me, but went away to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>But I did not see any other of the apostles, save James the brother of the Lord.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>Now as to what I write to you, behold, God is witness that I do not lie.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>Then I went to the regions of Syria, and Cilicia,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>and was personally unknown to the Christian congregations of Judea,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>who had only heard that he who formerly persecuted us is now proclaiming the glad tidings of that belief which he was formerly destroying,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>and they glorified God on my account.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>About fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I went up indeed according to a revelation, and stated to them the glad tidings which I proclaim among the nations; privately indeed to those in high repute, that the race, which I run, or had run, might in no wise be frustrate.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>But neither Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>nor did I, (on account of the false brethren who had slily introduced themselves, and crept in, to spy out that liberty of ours which we have by Christ Jesus, that they might enslave us)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>yield for a moment any submission to them, that the truth of the glad tidings might continue with you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And with regard to those in high repute (what they were formerly doth not concern me: God accepteth not man's person; for these men of repute added nothing to me;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>but, on the contrary, seeing that I was intrusted with the message of glad tidings for the uncircumcision, as Peter was with that for the circumcision;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>for he, who had communicated power to Peter for the mission to the circumcision, communicated power also to me for the nations)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>even James, and Cephas, and John, those eminent pillars, knowing the favour granted to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should be for the nations, and they for the circumcision,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>recommending only that we would remember the poor, which very thing I had indeed been forward to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And when Peter came to Antioch I opposed him to his face, because he was reprehensible.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For before certain persons came from James, he had eaten with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew, and kept himself apart, being afraid of them who were of the circumcision.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him, insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before them all, If thou being a Jew mayst live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, why compellest thou the Gentiles to conform to the rites of the Jews?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>We who are by nature Jews, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>knowing that a man is not justified by works of law unless by means of a belief in Jesus Christ, even, we ourselves have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified for a belief in Christ and not for works of law; because for works of law no flesh can be justified.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But if we, seeking to be justified by Christ, have ourselves also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Let not this be supposed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Now if I build up again that which I pulled down I make myself a transgressor.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>As for me, I by law died to law, that I may live to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>I have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; not I myself any more, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in flesh, I live by that belief which I have in the son of God, who loved me and delivered up himself for me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>do not set at naught the favour of God; for if righteousness be by means of law, Christ hath indeed died to no purpose.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Inconsiderate Galatians! who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth; you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ crucified was evidently represented among you?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>I wish to learn from you this only; Did you receive the spirit for works of law, or for the obedience of belief?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Are you so unwise? Having begun with spirit are you now perfecting your selves with flesh?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Have you suffered so many things in vain? But if indeed in vain;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>doth he then, who ministereth the spirit to you abundantly, and worketh miracles among you, do this for works of law, or for the obedience of belief?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness, 7 know therefore, that they who are believers are children of Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>The scripture indeed, foreseeing that God would justify the nations for belief, predicted to Abraham the glad tidings in these words, By thee all the nations shall be blessed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>So that they who are believers are blessed with the believing Abraham.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For as many as are of works of law are under a curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one who will not persevere in all that. are written in the book of the law to do them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>And that none is justified by law in the sight of God is evident, for the just shall live because of faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Now the law is not because of belief, but, The man who doth these things shall live by them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>From this curse of the law Christ hath redeemed us, being made a curse for us; (for it is written, Cursed, is every one who is suspended on a cross,)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the nations by Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the spirit by means of this belief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Brethren (I speak according to the practice of men) as no one disannulleth the covenant of a man, or superaddeth to it when it is ratified;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>and the promises were made to Abraham and the seed of him (it is not said and to the seeds as if it was a covenant for many, but as if for one, and to the seed of thee; namely Christ)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>now this I say that the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul a covenant ratified by God for Christ, so as to put a stop to the promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise; but God granted it freely by promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>To what purpose then was the law? On the account of transgressions it was superadded until the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; and it was introduced through angels by the hand of a mediator;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>but this mediator was not of one party. But God is one party;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>is then the law against the promises of God? No by no means; for if a law had been given which could have put into a state of life, righteousness would assuredly have been by law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But the scripture hath shut all up under sin, that the promise for belief in Jesus Christ might be granted to them who believe.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Now before this belief came, we were under the custody of law, shut up together for the future belief to be revealed.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>So that the law was our tutor to guide us to Christ, that we might be justified for belief.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>But this belief being come, we are no longer under a tutor;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>for you are all children of God by means of this belief in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>For as many of you as have been baptized to Christ, have put on Christ,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>There is in him no distinction of Jew and Greek, no distinction of bondman and freeman, no distinction of male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>And if you are Christ's, you are then the seed of Abraham and heirs according to promise.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now I say, as long as the heir is a minor, he differeth nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>but is under governors and guardians till the time prefixed by the Father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>So we also when minors were in bondage, under the elements of the world;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>but when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his son, born of a woman; born under law</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>that he might redeem those under law; that we may receive the adoption of children.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And because you are children, God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>So that thou art no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son; then an heir of God through Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>At the time indeed An objection. The answer. when you knew not God, you as slaves served things which are in reality no gods;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>but now when you know God, or rather when God hath owned you, how turn ye again to those weak and beggarly elements to which you degradingly desire again to be in bondage as before.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>You observe days and months and seasons and years;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>I am afraid for you lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Brethren be, I beseech you, as I, for I am as you were. You have not injured me at all;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>and you know that when in a weakness of the flesh I proclaimed to you formerly the glad tidings;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>with respect to that trial of mine, which I had in my flesh, you did not despise, nor with scorn reject, but received me as a messenger of God, as Christ Jesus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>What was then your felicitation! For I bear you witness, that if it had been possible you would have pulled out your very eyes and given them to me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you truth?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>They affect a zeal for you; not in an honourable way; but they wish to exclude us, that you may be zealous for them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Now it is honourable to be zealously affected towards a good man at all times, and not barely when I am present with you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>My dear children, for whom I again suffer pangs until Christ be formed in you</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>but I wish I could this moment be with you and change the tone of my voice, for I am in doubt about you</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>tell me ye who desire to be under law, do ye not hear the law?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by a bondwoman, and one by a freewoman:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>but he indeed who was of the bondwoman, was born in the ordinary course of nature; and he who was of the freewoman, in virtue of the promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>These things have an allegorical meaning, for by these women are represented the two covenants; one from mount Sina, bringing forth for bondage; this is Hagar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>(for Hagar meaneth mount Sina in Arabia) and answereth to the present Jerusalem, who with her children is in a state of bondage:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>but the Jerusalem above is free: this is the mother of us all;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>for it is written, Hagar, (which in Arabic signifies a rock) was and still is the name of Sina among the Arabians; Rejoice thou barren, who bearest not; Break forth with shouts of joy, Thou who sufferest not the pangs of childbirth, For many more are the children of the desolate, Than of her who hath a husband.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>Now we, brethren, are children of promise, as Isaak was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="29">
      <content>But as then he who was born in the ordinary course of nature persecuted him who was born in a spiritual manner, even so it is now.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="30">
      <content>But what saith the scripture? Send away this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not share the inheritance with the son of the freewoman.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="31">
      <content>Now we, brethren, are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free;</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>therefore stand up for the liberty with which Christ hath made us free, and be not again entangled with a yoke of bondage.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Behold I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And I testify again to every man who is circumcised, that he is under an obligation to perform the whole law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>You who are justified by law, have done with the Christ; you have fallen from that favour.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>As for us then, we by the spirit entertain a hope of justification for faith.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing, but a belief made operative by love.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>You were running well. Who hath stopped you from obeying the truth?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>This persuasion cometh not from him who called you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>A little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>I have a confidence in the Lord with respect to you, that you will keep your minds bent on nothing else, and that he who troubleth you, whoever he may be, will bear the blame</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>As for me, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offence of the cross is done away.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>I wish that they who are unsettling you would cut themselves off:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>for you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only let not that liberty be an advantage to the flesh; but be servants to one another by offices of love.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For the whole law is summed up in this one precept, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>Now if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not destroyed by one another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>This then I say, walk by the spirit and by no means fulfil the lust of the flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For the inclinations of the flesh are contrary to the spirit; and the inclinations of the spirit are contrary to the flesh; they are opposed to one another; so that you do not, what you wish;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>but if you are led by the spirit you are not under law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>Now the works of the flesh are manifest; they are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>idolatry, fascinations, enmities, strifes, emulations, animosities, contentions, factions, sects,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and the like, of which I forewarn you, as I have indeed before declared that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>meekness, temperance; against such things there is no law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Now they who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>If we live by spirit let us walk by spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>Let us not be vain glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</content>

  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, do you, who are spiritual, set such a one right again, with a spirit of meekness, keeping an eye on thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>Bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of the Christ.</content>

      <content>Be not deceived. God is not to be imposed on; for whatever a man soweth, that he shall reap.</content>
