    <verse num="1">
      <content>GOD, who in sundry parcels and in divers manners spake in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>hath in these last days spoken to us by a son whom he hath constituted heir of all things, by whom also he made the ages;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>who being an effulgence of the glory, and an impress of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having by himself made a purification of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>being made as much superior to the heavenly messengers as the name he hath inherited is more excellent than theirs:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>for to which of those messengers did he ever say, Thou art my son, this day I have begotten thee. And again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>And again when he would bring the first born into the world, he saith, And let all God's messengers worship him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now in respect to the messengers it is said, Who maketh winds his messengers, and flaming fire his ministers:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>but with respect to the son, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: The sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of rectitude:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Thou didst love righteousness and hate iniquity, Therefore God, thy God anointed thee With the oil of joy above thy associates?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>Again, Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of thy hand.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>They shall perish, but thou wilt endure. They shall all wax old like a garment,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>And like a mantle thou wilt fold them up and they shall be changed: But as for thee, thou art the same And thy years shall have no end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And to which of these messengers did he ever say, Sit at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth on service on the account of them who are to be heirs of salvation?</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For this cause we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest we, through negligence, let them slip.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For if the word spoken by messengers was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received as its reward a correspondent requital,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation, which was first published by the Lord, and confirmed for us by them who heard him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>God giving a joint testimony, by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of a holy spirit, according to his own will.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>For he did not subject to angels the dispensation to come, of which we are speaking;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>but one in a certain place hath testified, saying, What is man, that thou shouldst be mindful of him! Or a son of man, that thou shouldst visit him!</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Thou madest him a little lower than angels; With glory and honour thou hast crowned him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>And set him over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet. For when he put all things under his feet, he left nothing which was not put in subjection to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But we see him who was made a little lower than angels namely Jesus, on account of suffering death crowned with glory and honour, that so he by the favour of God might taste death for every man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, when bringing many sons to glory to make the leader of their salvation perfect by sufferings.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>For both he who sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren, In the midst of a congregation I will praise thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>And, again: I will trust in him; and, again: Here am I and the children whom God hath given me.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>As the children therefore were partakers of flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same in order that he might, by his death, put a stop to the operation of him who hath the power of death, that is the devil;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>and deliver from bondage them who were all their lives liable to the fear of death.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For he indeed doth not take hold of angels, but taketh hold of the seed of Abraham,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>whence it behoved him to be made like his brethren in all things; that he might be a merciful and faithful chief priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For by what he himself suffered when he was tried he can help them who are tried.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly invitation, consider attentively this apostle and chief priest of our profession, namely Christ Jesus</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>who was faithful to him who appointed him, even as Moses was, in his whole house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For he hath been counted worthy of as much greater honour than Moses, as he who hath builded a house hath more honour than the house.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For every house hath some builder, but he who builded all things is God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Now Moses was faithful in this whole house of his as a servant for a testimony of those things to be spoken;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>but Christ as a son over his own house, whose house we are, if we stedfastly maintain this confidence, and the boast of this hope, firm to the end.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Wherefore as the Holy Spirit saith, Today since you have heard his voice,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Let not your hearts be refractory as at Bitterness as in the day of the temptation in the wilderness;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Where your fathers tried me; they proved me, though they saw my works. Forty years.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For which cause I was incensed with that generation; And said, They do always err with the heart, And have not known my ways:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>So in mine indignation I solemnly said, They shall not enter into my rest.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>Take heed, brethren, that there be not in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>but while this today is proclaimed, that none of you may be rendered obstinate by the deceitfulness of sin</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>(for we are made associates of the Christ if we retain the beginning of this confidence firm to the end)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>exhort one another daily by its being said, Today since you have heard his voice let not your hearts be refractory as at Bitterness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For some hearers provoked him; but did they not all come out of Egypt by Moses?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>Now, against whom was he incensed forty years? Was it not against them who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>And to whom did he solemnly say that they should not enter into his rest, but to them who were disobedient.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Let us therefore be afraid, lest having a promise left of entering into His Rest any of us should fall short of it.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>For we have had the glad tidings proclaimed to us, as they also had; but the word which they heard did not profit them; as it was not mixed up with belief by the hearers.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For we who have believed enter into that rest spoken of in this passage, So in my indignation I said they shall not enter into My Rest; namely, That from the works done at the foundation of the, world.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For where speaking of the seventh day the scripture said thus, And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>And again in this place: They shall not enter into My rest.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Therefore since it is left for some to enter into it, and they who had the glad tidings first proclaimed to them did not enter in because of unbelief,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>He again determinately apointeth out a day, namely Today, saying by David after so long a time, as it hath been mentioned, Today since you have heard his voice let not your hearts be refractory.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>For if Joshua had given them rest, the scripture would not after that have spoken of another day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>There is then a Sabbath rest left for the people of God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For he who entereth into That Rest Of His hath desisted from his works, as God did from his.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Let us therefore use all diligence to enter into This Rest, that none may fall short by a like example of disobedience.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrateth even to the separation of animal life and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is capable of discerning the desires and thoughts of the heart.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>There is indeed no creature concealed from his sight. All things are naked and exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Having therefore a great chief priest who hath passed through the heavens, namely Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 15 For we have not a chief priest incapable of sympathizing in our infirmities; but one who hath been tried in all respects like ourselves, but without sin.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>Let us therefore come with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find favour for seasonable assistance.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For every chief priest, taken from among men, is constituted for men over things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>being able to treat the ignorant and wandering with moderation and compassion, encompassed as he himself is with infirmity;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>and for this reason it is his duty to offer sacrifices for sins, as well for himself as for the people.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now no one assumeth to himself this honour, but he who is called of God as Aaron was.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Thus also the Christ did not dignify himself with the office of chief priest, but was dignified with it by him who said to him, Thou art my son; this day I have begotten the</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Just as he saith also in another psalm, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>He, (who in the days of his flesh, having, with a strong cry and tears, offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and being hearkened to, did, from a reverential awe notwithstanding his being a son, learn obedience from what he suffered;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>and being consecrated became the author of everlasting salvation to all who obey him,)</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>was proclaimed by God a chief priest after the order of Melchisedek,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>concerning whom we have much to say, but not easy to be explained as you are slow of apprehension.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need of some one to teach you over again the first elements of the oracles of God, and have need of milk and not strong food: 13 for every one who useth milk is unskilled in the doctrine of justification, for he is a babe,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>and this strong food is for full grown men, who by long practice and exercise have their senses improved for the discernment of both good and evil.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Therefore dropping the discourse of the government of the Christ, let us, without laying again a foundation of reformation from dead works, and of faith in God,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>of the doctrine concerning baptism, and the laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment, proceed to the consecration.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>And this we will do if God permit:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>for with regard to them who have been once enlightened, and have tasted this free, this heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of a holy spirit,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>and tasted the good word of God, and the miraculous powers of the age about to come,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>and have fallen off; it is impossible to renew them again for a reformation, since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the son of God and exposing him to open shame.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For ground which drinketh up the rain that frequently falleth on it, and produceth plants fit for the use of them for whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>but that which produceth briars and thorns is rejected, and near a curse, the end of which is for burning.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>But respecting you, beloved, we are persuaded better things, even things which accompany salvation; though we speak thus.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>For God is not unjust to forget your work, and the labour of that love which you have shewn for his name, by the assistance which you have given and continue to give to the saints.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Now we earnestly desire that every one of you would shew the same diligent concern for the full assurance of this hope to the end:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>that you may not become languid, but imitators of them who through faith and long suffering inherit the promises.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For when God made a promise to Abraham, as he had none greater to swear by, he swore by himself,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And so he, having waited with patience, obtained the promise.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>For men indeed swear by a greater, and an oath for confirmation being to them an end of strife,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>God, willing on this occasion to shew more fully to the heirs of this promise the immutability of his determination, interposed an oath,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to deceive, there might be strong consolation for us who have fled to take hold of this proffered hope,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast; and which entereth within the veil,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>whither a forerunner hath entered for us, namely Jesus, made a chief priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham on his return from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all, was in the first place, by the interpretation of his name, king of righteousness, and in the, next place he was actually king of Salem, that is, king of peace;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>of whose father and mother there is no mention, no account of descent, nor of the beginning of his days, nor of the end of his life, but likened to the son of God he abideth a priest continually.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>Now consider what a great personage he was to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>The Levites indeed who receive the priesthood have according to law a commandment to tithe the people, that is their own brethren descended from the loins of Abraham;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>but he who was not of their pedigree received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>Now, beyond all dispute, the inferior is blessed by the superior.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>Again, here indeed men who die receive tithes; but there HE received them of whom it is testified that he liveth.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>Indeed, as one may say, even Levi who receiveth tithes, was tithed in the person of Abraham;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Again, if perfectness had been by the Levitical priesthood (for it was for this that the people received the law) what further need was there of saying that another priest should be raised up after the order of Melchisedek, and not after the order of Aaron?</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>For the priesthood being changed there is of necessity a change of the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>For he in respect to whom these things are said belonged to another tribe, none of whom gave attendance at the altar.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>For it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, in respect to which tribe Moses spake nothing of a priesthood.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>And this is still more clear, if after the likeness of Melchisedek another priest is raised up,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>who is made not according to the law of a commandment concerning flesh, but according to the power of an endless life.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>For he testifieth, saying, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedek.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>Here then is a disannulment of a preceding commandment on account of its weakness and inutility,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>(for the law made nothing perfect) and an introduction of a better hope by which we draw near to God.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>And inasmuch as this was not without an oath, 21 (for with regard to them, they indeed were made priests without an oath, but he was made with an oath, by him who said to him, The Lord hath sworn and will not change, thou art a priest forever after the order of 'Melchisedek,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>by so much Jesus is made the surety of a better covenant.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>Again, with regard to them, many were made priests, because death prevented a continuance: 24 but He, because of his continuing forever, hath a priesthood which doth not pass from one to another.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>---</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>So that he is completely able to save them, who come to God by him, as he is ever alive to intercede for them.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="26">
      <content>For it suited us to have such a chief priest; one holy, innocent, undefined, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="27">
      <content>who is not under a daily necessity (as the chief priests are,) of offering sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; for this he did once for all when he offered up himself.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="28">
      <content>For the law constituteth men chief priests who have infirmities; but the word of the oath which succeedeth the law constituted the Son, who is consecrated forever.</content>
    </verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">
      <content>Now the sum of what I have said is this, Such a chief priest we have who hath taken a seat at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>he is a minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>For every chief priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that H E should have something to offer;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>for if he were on earth he could not be a priest, as there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>These perform divine service for a sample and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely admonished, when he was about to make the tabernacle, for it is said, see that thou make all things according to the model shewn thee on this mountain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>Now then He hath more noble services allotted to him, in as much as he is the mediator of a better covenant, which is established on better promises.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>For if the first covenant had been faultless there would have been no occasion for a second</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>for finding fault with them he saith, Behold days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and the house of Judah.</content>
