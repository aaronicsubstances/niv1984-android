    <verse num="1">
      <content>Jude a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James; to the called, who are sanctified by God the father, and preserved by Jesus Christ:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="2">
      <content>mercy be to you, and may peace and love be multiplied.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="3">
      <content>Beloved, when I was using all diligence to write to you respecting the common salvation, I found a necessity to write to you, and exhort you to contend earnestly for the belief which was once for all delivered to the saints.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="4">
      <content>For Certain persons have slily crept in among us, who have been of old written of, and for this very crime, wicked men, who are turning the favour of our God into licentiousness, and denying our only sovereign God, and Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="5">
      <content>Now I desire once for all to remind you of this which you knew, That the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, destroyed afterwards them who did not believe:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="6">
      <content>and the angels who did not keep their own government, but left their proper abode, he hath reserved in perpetual bonds, under darkness, for the judgment of the great day.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="7">
      <content>As Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, which, in like manner with them, abandoned themselves to licentiousness, and went after strange flesh, were made an example of, suffering the vengeance of everlasting fire;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="8">
      <content>so likewise shall these dreamers. They indeed defile the flesh, and despise authority and revile glories,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="9">
      <content>whereas Michael the archangel, when he contended with the devil, and disputed about the body of Moses, did not take the liberty to bring against him a railing accusation, but said the Lord rebuke thee:</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="10">
      <content>but these rail at what they do not know; and what they do know in a natural way as irrational animals, with these they corrupt themselves.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="11">
      <content>Alas for them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, and rambled in the error of Balaam's reward and perished in the rebellion of Kore.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="12">
      <content>They are hidden rocks in your love feasts. When they feast with you, they feed themselves without restraint. They are clouds without water, impelled by winds; autumnal trees without fruit, twice dead, and to be rooted up;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="13">
      <content>raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the gloom of everlasting darkness.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="14">
      <content>Now to such as these Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold the Lord is coming with his holy myriads</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="15">
      <content>to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the wicked among them of all their impious deeds, which they have impiously committed, and of all the bitter things which impious sinners have uttered against him.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="16">
      <content>They are discontented mumurers, walking after their own lusts. Though their mouth speaketh swelling words, they hold persons in admiration for the sake of gain.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="17">
      <content>But as for you, beloved, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold you.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="18">
      <content>For they assured you that in the last time there would be scoffers, walking after their own wicked desires.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="19">
      <content>These are they who separate themselves, being sensual, and not having the spirit.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="20">
      <content>But as for you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying with a holy spirit,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="21">
      <content>keep yourselves in the love of God, as you expect the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for everlasting life;</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="22">
      <content>and making a distinction, have compassion on some,</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="23">
      <content>and save others by fear, snatching them out of the fire; abhorring even a garment which is stained by flesh.</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="24">
      <content>Now to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to present you, without blemish, before his glory with great joy</content>
    </verse>
    <verse num="25">
      <content>to the only wise God, our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.</content>
